= Backup and restore

The cluster backup and restore operator provides disaster recovery solutions for {product-title} hub cluster failure. The cluster backup and restore operato runs on the hub cluster and depends on the link:https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator[OADP Operator] to install Velero, and to create a connection from the hub cluster to the backup storage location where the data is stored. 

Velero is the component that runs the backup and restore operations. The cluster backup and restore operator solution provides backup and restore support for all {product-title-short} hub cluster resources, including managed clusters, applications, policies, and bare metal assets.

The cluster backup and restore operator supports backups of any third-party resources that extend the hub cluster installation. With this backup solution, you can define cron-based backup schedules which run at specified time intervals. When the hub cluster goes down, a new hub cluster can be deployed and the backed up data is moved to the new hub cluster. See the documentation.
