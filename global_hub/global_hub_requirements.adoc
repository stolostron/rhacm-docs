[#gh-general-requirements]
== General requirements

To install Global hub, you need the following requirements:

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

*{ocp-short} Dedicated environment required access:* You must have `cluster-admin` permissions. By default `dedicated-admin` role does not have the required permissions to create namespaces in the {ocp-short} Dedicated environment. 

* {acm} must be installed and configured. link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9[Learn more details about {acm-short}].


[#gh-network-requirements]
== Networking requirements

See the following networking requirements:

* The managed hub is also a managed cluster of {global-hub} in {acm-short}. The network configuration in {acm-short} is necessary. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/networking/networking[Networking] for {acm-short} networking details.

* The following table lists the Global hub network information:
+
|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified) | Source address |	Destination address |
    
| Inbound from browser of the user | HTTPS | User need to access the Grafana dashboard | 443 | Browser of the user | IP address of Grafana route |
| Outbound to Kafka Cluster | HTTPS | Global hub manager need to get data from Kafka cluster | 443 | multicluster-global-hub-manager-xxx pod | Kafka route host |
| Outbound to PostgreSQL database | HTTPS | Global hub manager need to persist data to PostgreSQL database | 443 | multicluster-global-hub-manager-xxx pod | IP address of the PostgreSQL database |
|===

* The following table lists the Managed hub network information:
+
|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified) | Source address |	Destination address |
    
| Outbound to Kafka Cluster | HTTPS | Global hub agent need to sync cluster info and policy info to Kafka cluster | 443 | multicluster-global-hub-agent pod | Kafka route host |
|===

* You can see guidelines for sizing at link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/install/installing#sizing-your-cluster[Sizing your {acm-short} cluster] in the product documentation.

* *Optional:* For middleware, {global-hub} has built-in Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Grafana, but you can use your own configured Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Grafana. See xref:../global_hub/global_hub_components.adoc#global-hub-integrating-existing-components[Integrating existing components] for more details.

[#gh-supported-components]
== Supported components

Learn about supported platforms and components.

* Because they share an integrated console, the {global-hub} console supports the same browsers as the {ocp-short}. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/web_console/index#web-console[Accessing the web console] in the {ocp} documentation for information about supported browsers and versions.

* The following table lists platforms that are available for the supported {global-hub} cluster:

+
|===
|Platform | Supported for global hub cluster | Supported for managed hub cluster

|{acm-short} 2.11, and later 2.11.x releases | Yes |	Yes
|{acm-short} 2.10, and later 2.10.x releases | Yes |	Yes
|{acm-short} 2.9, and later 2.9.x releases |	Yes |	Yes
|{acm-short} on Arm | Yes | Yes |
{acm-short} on IBM Z | Yes | Yes
|{acm-short} on IBM Power Systems | Yes | Yes
|===

* The {global-hub} supports the following middleware:

** Kafka 3.4 and later 3.4.x releases.

** PostgreSQL version 13 and later 13.x releases.
