[#global-hub-architecture]
= Multicluster global hub architecture

The multicluster global hub consists of several components, which are used to access and manage your hub clusters. Learn more about the architecture in the following sections.

[#global-hub-operator]
== Multicluster Global Hub Operator

The multicluster global hub Operator contains the components of multicluster global hub. The Operator deploys all of the required components for global multicluster management. The components include `multicluster-global-hub-manager` in the global hub cluster and `multicluster-global-hub-agent` in the managed hub clusters.

The Operator also leverages the `manifestwork` custom resource to deploy the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes Operator on the managed cluster. After the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management Operator is deployed on the managed cluster, the managed cluster becomes a standard {product-title-short} cluster. This hub cluster is now a managed hub cluster.

[#global-hub-manager]
== Multicluster global hub manager

The Multicluster Global Hub Manager is used to persist the data into the `postgreSQL` database. The data is from Kafka transport. The manager also posts the data to the Kafka transport, so it can be synchronized with the data on the managed hub clusters.

[#global-hub-agent]
== Multicluster global hub agent

The Multicluster Global Hub Agent runs on the managed hub clusters. It synchronizes the data between the global hub cluster and the managed hub clusters. For example, the agent synchronizes the information of the managed clusters from the managed hub clusters with the global hub cluster and synchronizes the policy or application from the global hub cluster and the managed hub clusters.

[#global-hub-observability]
== Multicluster global hub observability

Grafana runs on the global hub cluster as the main service for Global Hub Observability. The Postgres data collected by the Global Hub Manager is its default DataSource. By exposing the service using the route called `multicluster-global-hub-grafana`, you can access the global hub Grafana dashboards by accessing the console.
