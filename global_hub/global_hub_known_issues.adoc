[#operator-hyperlink]
== Globalhub Operator installed in {ocp-short} 4.13 might redirect

//workaround?


[#no-new-page-group-filter]
== Globalhub Operator installed in {ocp-short} 4.13 might redirect

In the Global Hub Policy Group Compliancy Overview hub dashboards, you can check one data point by clicking **View Offending Policies for standard group**, but after you click this link to go to the offending page, the standard group filter cannot pass to the new page. 

This is also an issue for the **Cluster Group Compliancy Overview**.
