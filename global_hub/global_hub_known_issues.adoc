[#operator-hyperlink]
== Globalhub Operator installed on {ocp-short} 4.13 hyperlinks might redirect

You need to manually go to your target page.

== Globalhub Operator installed in {ocp-short} 4.13 might redirect

In the Global Hub Policy Group Compliancy Overview hub dashboards, you can check one data point by clicking **View Offending Policies for standard group**, but after you click this link to go to the offending page, the standard group filter cannot pass to the new page. 

This is also an issue for the **Cluster Group Compliancy Overview**.

- Detach Managed Hub may cause applications and policies deleted.
If Global Hub running on RHACM 2.7.9, When the Managed Hub is detached, all policies and applications created on managed hub will be deleted.

- Policy cannot be propagated to the Managed Hub cluster
If Global Hub is running on RHACM 2.8.3 or below, policy cannot be propagated to the managed hub cluster due to https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-8338. 
The workaround is to create a namespace <Managed Hub Name> in the managed hub cluster.

- Can not redirect to OpenShift 3.11 cluster Observability page.
If a managed hub import an Openshift 3.11 cluster as managed cluster, It can not redirect to the `RHACM Observability` page in `Global Hub - Overview` dashboard.

Please manually redirect to your target page.
