= Importing a managed hub cluster in the default mode

To import an existing hub cluster as a managed hub cluster, complete the following steps:

. Import the managed hub cluster by completing the steps in link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/import_intro.adoc#import-intro[Cluster import introduction].
