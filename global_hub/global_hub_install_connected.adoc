[#global-hub-install-connected]
= Installing {global-hub} in a connected environment 

The {global-hub} is installed through {olm}, which manages the installation, upgrade, and removal of the components that comprise the operator. 

*Required access:* Cluster administrator 

[#global-hub-install-connected-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

- For the {ocp-short} Dedicated environment, you must have `cluster-admin` permissions to access the environment. By default `dedicated-admin` role does not have the required permissions to create namespaces in the {ocp-short} Dedicated environment.
- You must install and configure {acm}. For more details, see link:../install/install_overview.adoc#installing[Installing and upgrading].
- You must configure the {acm-short} network. The managed hub cluster is also a managed cluster of {global-hub} in {acm-short}. For more details, see link:../networking/network_config_hub.adoc#hub-network-config[Hub cluster network configuration].
