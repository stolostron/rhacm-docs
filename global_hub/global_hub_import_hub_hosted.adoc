= Importing a managed hub cluster in the hosted mode (Technology Preview)

To enable `local-cluster` on your managed hub cluster, you must import it in the hosted mode.  

[#global-hub-importing-prereq]
== Prerequisite

- Enable `local-cluster` in the {global-hub} cluster.

[#global-hub-importing-hosted-mode]
== Importing a hub cluster in the hosted mode 

To import an existing hub cluster that has `local-cluster` enabled, you must use the hosted mode. In the hosted mode, you only get support for import managed hub clusters that use `kubeconfig` or API tokens. {acm} uses this `kubeconfig` or API token to generate the `auto-import-secret`, which connects to the managed hub cluster. 

*Note:*

- Make sure this `kubeconfig` or API token is always usable. If it expires, regenerate the `auto-import-secret` in the managed hub cluster namespace with the following command: `oc create secret generic auto-import-secret --from-file=kubeconfig=./managedClusterKubeconfig -n <Managedhub Namespace>`. 

Complete the following steps: 

. Set the annotation `global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/import-cluster-in-hosted=true` to `globalhub cr`.
. Import your managed hub cluster. 

With this annotation, {global-hub} does the following actions:

- Imports all the new managed hub clusters in hosted mode.
- Disables the following `addons` in the new managed hub clusters namespaces: `applicationManager`, `certPolicyController`, and `policyController`. 
- Changes the following managed hub clusters `addons` that are related to the new namespace: `work-manager`,`cluster-proxy`, and `managed-serviceaccount`. 
- Changes these namespaces to `open-cluster-management-global-hub-agent-addon`.
