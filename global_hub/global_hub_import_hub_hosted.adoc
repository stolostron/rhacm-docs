= Importing a managed hub cluster in the hosted mode (Technology Preview)

Import a managed hub cluster in the hosted mode to import any managed hub clusters where you want to have `local-cluster` enabled. 

[#global-hub-importing-prereq]
== Prerequisites
- Enable `local-cluster` in the {global-hub} cluster.

To import existing hub cluster which has `local-cluster` enabled, you must use the hosted mode to import the existing hub cluster. Complete the following steps: 

. Set the annotation `global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/import-cluster-in-hosted=true` to globalhub cr.

With this annotation, {global-hub} does the following actions:
- Import all the new managed hub clusters in hosted mode.
- Disable the following `addons` in the new managed hub clusters namespaces: `applicationManager`, `certPolicyController`, and `policyController`.  
- Change the managed hub clusters `addons` that are related to the new namespace, including:  `work-manager`,`cluster-proxy`, and `managed-serviceaccount`. Change these namespaces to `open-cluster-management-global-hub-agent-addon`. 

*Notes:*
- In the hosted mode, you only get support for import managed hub clusters that use `kubeconfig` or API tokens. {acm} uses this `kubeconfig` or API token to generate the `auto-import-secret`, which connects to the managed hub cluster.
- Make sure this `kubeconfig` or API token is always usable. If it expires,  regenerate the `auto-import-secret` in the managed hub namespace, `oc create secret generic auto-import-secret --from-file=kubeconfig=./managedClusterKubeconfig -n <Managedhub Namespace>`
