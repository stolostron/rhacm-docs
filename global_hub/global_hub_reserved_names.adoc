[#global-hub-reserved-labels]
== Labels

List all of the labels that are used by the multicluster global hub.

|===
| Label  | Description

| global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/managed-by=`global-hub-operator\|global-hub\|global-hub-agent` 
| If the value is `global-hub-operator`, the resources are created by the global hub operator. The global hub operator watches the resources based on this label. 

| global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/global-resource=  
| This label is added when creating the global resources. It is used to identify the resource that transport needs to propagate to the managed hub clusters.

| global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/agent-deploy-mode = `Hosted\| Default\| None`  
| This label is used on ManagedCluster. `Hosted` means the global hub agent is deployed on Hosting cluster. `Default` means the global hub agent is deployed on managed cluster. `None` means the global hub agent is not installed. 

| global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/hub-cluster-install=   
| This label is used on ManagedCluster. If this label exists, the global hub operator installs Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management on a managed cluster. If the label is not included, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management is not installed on the managed cluster by the global hub operator.

| global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/origin-ownerreference-uid= 
|This annotation is used to identify that the resource is from the global hub cluster. The global hub agent is only handled with the resource which has this annotation.

| hub.open-cluster-management.io     
| The value is the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management Hub installation mode. `NotInstalled`: The {product-title-short} Hub is not installed on the cluster.`InstalledByUser`: The {product-title-short} (or Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager) Hub has been installed before the global hub is deployed.`InstalledByGlobalHub`: The {product-title-short} Hub was installed by Global Hub. |
