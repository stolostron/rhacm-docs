[#global-hub-install-disconnected]
= Installing {global-hub} in a disconnected environment

If your cluster is in a restricted network, you can deploy the {global-hub} operator in the disconnected environment. 

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-prereq]
== Prerequisites

You must meet the following requirements before you install {global-hub} in a disconnected environment:

- An image registry and a bastion host must have access to both the internet and to your mirror registry.
- Install the Operator Lifecycle Manager on your cluster. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/operators/index#operator-lifecycle-manager-olm[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)].
- Install {acm}.
- Install the following command line interfaces:
+
* The {ocp-short} command line. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the {ocp-short} CLI].
* The `opm` command line. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/cli_reference/opm/cli-opm-install.html[Installing the opm CLI].
//this was written after we all said we would stop linking to this webpage, (in many meetings) bc of the future sunset of this site.
* The  `oc-mirror` plugin. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/disconnected_installation_mirroring/installing-mirroring-disconnected[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation using the oc-plugin].

[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-mirror]
== Configuring a mirror registry

Installing {global-hub} in a disconnected environment involves the use of a local mirror image registry. At this point, it is assumed that you have set up a mirror registry during the {ocp-short} cluster installation.

Complete the following procedures to provision the mirror registry for {global-hub}:

[#global-hub-packages-in-catalog]
=== Creating operator packages in mirror catalog with oc-mirror plug-in

Red Hat provides the {global-hub} and AMQ Streams operators in the Red Hat operators catalog, which are delivered by the `registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index` index image. When you prepare your mirror of this catalog index image, you can choose to either mirror the entire catalog as provided by Red Hat, or you can mirror a subset that contains only the operator packages that you intend to use.

If you are creating a full mirror catalog, no special considerations are needed as all of the packages required to install {global-hub} and AMQ Streams are included. However, if you are creating a partial or filtered mirrored catalog, for which you identify particular packages to be included, you must to include the `multicluster-global-hub-operator-rh` and `amq-streams` package names in your list. 

Complete the following steps to create a local mirror registry of the `multicluster-global-hub-operator-rh` and `amq-streams` packages:

. Create a `ImageSetConfiguration` YAML file to configure and add the operator image. Your YAML file might resemble the following content, with the current version replacing `4.x`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
storageConfig:
  registry:
      imageURL: myregistry.example.com:5000/mirror/oc-mirror-metadata
mirror:
  platform:
    channels:
    - name: stable-4.x
      type: ocp
  operators:
  - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.x
    packages:
    - name: multicluster-global-hub-operator-rh
    - name: amq-streams
  additionalImages: []
  helm: {}
----

. Mirror the image set directly to the target mirror registry by using the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc mirror --config=./imageset-config.yaml docker://myregistry.example.com:5000
----

. Mirror the image set in a fully disconnected environment. For more details, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/disconnected_installation_mirroring#installing-mirroring-installation-images[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation].


[#global-hub-add-reg-in-catalog]
=== Adding the registry and catalog to your disconnected cluster

To make your mirror registry and catalog available on your disconnected cluster. Complete the following steps:

. Disable the default catalog sources of Operator Hub. Run the following command to update the `OperatorHub` resource:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
-p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
----

. Mirror the Operator catalog by completing the procedure, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/operators/index#olm-mirror-catalog_olm-restricted-networks[Mirroring the Operator catalog].
. Add the `CatalogSource` resource for your mirrored catalog into the `openshift-marketplace` namespace. Your `CatalogSource` YAML file might be similar to the following example, with `4.x` set as the supported version:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: my-mirror-catalog-source
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  image: myregistry.example.com:5000/mirror/my-operator-index:v4.x
  sourceType: grpc
  secrets:
  - <global-hub-secret>
----
- *Note:* Take note of the value of the `metadata.name` field. 

. Save the updated file.

. Verify that the required packages are available from your disconnected cluster by querying the available `PackageManifest` resources. Run the following command:
with the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc -n openshift-marketplace get packagemanifests
----
+
The list that is displayed should include entries showing that the `multicluster-global-hub-operator-rh` and `amq-streams` packages are supplied by the catalog source for your mirror catalog:


[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-config-image-registry]
== Configuring the image registry

In order to have your cluster obtain container images for the {global-hub} operator from your local mirror registry, rather than from the internet-hosted registries, you must configure an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource on your disconnected cluster to redirect image references to your mirror registry. The `ImageContentSourcePolicy` only support the image mirror with image *digest*.

If you mirrored your catalog using the `oc adm catalog mirror` command, the needed image content source policy configuration is in the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file inside the `manifests-` directory that is created by that command.

If you used the `oc-mirror` plug-in to mirror your catalog instead, the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file is within the `oc-mirror-workspace/results-` directory created by the `oc-mirror` plug-in.

In either case, you can apply the policies to your disconnected command using an `oc apply` or `oc replace` command such as `oc replace -f ./<path>/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml`

The required image content source policy statements can vary based on how you created your mirror registry, but are similar to this example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageContentSourcePolicy
metadata:
  labels:
    operators.openshift.org/catalog: "true"
  name: global-hub-operator-icsp
spec:
  repositoryDigestMirrors:
  - mirrors:
    - myregistry.example.com:5000/multicluster-globalhub
    source: registry.redhat.io/multicluster-globalhub
  - mirrors:
    - myregistry.example.com:5000/openshift4
    source: registry.redhat.io/openshift4
  - mirrors:
    - myregistry.example.com:5000/redhat
    source: registry.redhat.io/redhat
----

You can configure different image registries for different managed hubs with the `ManagedClusterImageRegistry`. See link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/specify_img_registry.adoc#import-cluster-managedclusterimageregistry[Importing a cluster that has a ManagedClusterImageRegistry] to use the `ManagedClusterImageRegistry` API to replace the agent image.

By completing the previous step, a label and an annotation are added to the selected `ManagedCluster`. This means that the agent image in the cluster are replaced with the mirror image.

* Label: `multicluster-global-hub.io/image-registry=<namespace.managedclusterimageregistry-name>`
* Annotation: `multicluster-global-hub.io/image-registries: <image-registry-info>`


[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-pull-secret]
=== Configure the image pull secret

If the Operator or Operand images that are referenced by a subscribed Operator require access to a private registry, you can either link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/operators/index#olm-creating-catalog-from-index_olm-managing-custom-catalogs[provide access to all namespaces in the cluster, or to individual target tenant namespaces]. 

[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-pull-secret-generic]
==== Configure the {global-hub} image pull secret in an {ocp-short} cluster

You can configure the image pull secret in an existing {ocp-short} cluster.

*Note:* Applying the image pull secret on a pre-existing cluster causes a rolling restart of all of the nodes.

Complete the following steps to configure the pull secret: 

. Export the user name from the pull secret:
+
----
export USER=<the-registry-user>
----

. Export the password from the pull secret:
+
----
export PASSWORD=<the-registry-password>
----

. Copy the pull secret:
+
----
oc get secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --template='{{index .data ".dockerconfigjson" | base64decode}}' > pull_secret.yaml
----

. Log in using the pull secret:
+
----
oc registry login --registry=${REGISTRY} --auth-basic="$USER:$PASSWORD" --to=pull_secret.yaml
----

. Specify the {global-hub} image pull secret:
+
----
oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=pull_secret.yaml
----

. Remove the old pull secret:
+
----
rm pull_secret.yaml
----

[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-pull-secret-individual-namespace]
==== Configure the {global-hub} image pull secret to an individual namespace

You can configure the image pull secret to an individual namespace by completing the following steps:

. Create the secret in the tenant namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc create secret generic <secret_name> -n <tenant_namespace> \
--from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/registry/credentials> \
--type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----

. Link the secret to the service account for your operator or operand:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc secrets link <operator_sa> -n <tenant_namespace> <secret_name> --for=pull
----

[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-operator]
=== Installing the Global Hub Operator

You can install and subscribe an Operator from OperatorHub using the {ocp} web console. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Adding Operators to a cluster] for the procedure. After adding the Operator, you can check the status of the {global-hub} Operator by running the following command: 

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -n multicluster-global-hub
NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
multicluster-global-hub-operator-687584cb7c-fnftj   1/1     Running   0          2m12s
