= Multicluster global hub overview

The multicluster global hub is a set of components that enable the management of multiple hub clusters from a single hub cluster. You can deploy managed hub clusters, and list the managed clusters that are managed by all of the managed hub clusters.

The multicluster global hub is useful when a single hub cluster cannot manage the large number of clusters in a high-scale environment. When this happens, you divide the clusters into smaller groups of clusters and configure a hub cluster for each group. 

It is often inconvenient to view the data on multiple hub clusters for the managed clusters that are managed by that hub cluster. The multicluster global hub provides an easier way to view information from multiple hub clusters by designating the hub clusters as managed hub clusters. The global hub cluster manages the other hub clusters and gathers summarized information from the managed hub clusters.

* *Optional:* While multicluster global hub provides the built-in middleware instances, Kafka, PostgreSQL and Grafana, you can also bring your own middlewares.
