= multicluster global hub

The {global-hub} is a set of components that enable you to import one or more hub clusters and manage them from a single hub cluster.

After importing the hub clusters as managed hub clusters, you can use {global-hub} to complete the following tasks across all of the managed hub clusters:

* Report the policy compliance status and trend
* Inventory all managed hubs and managed clusters on the overview page
* Detect and alert in cases of irregular policy behavior

The {global-hub} is useful when a single hub cluster cannot manage the large number of clusters in a high-scale environment. When this happens, you divide the clusters into smaller groups of clusters and configure a hub cluster for each group. 

It is often inconvenient to view the data on multiple hub clusters for the managed clusters that are managed by that hub cluster. The {global-hub} provides an easier way to view information from multiple hubs by designating multiple hub clusters as managed hub clusters. The {global-hub} cluster manages the other hub clusters and gathers summarized information from the managed hub clusters.
