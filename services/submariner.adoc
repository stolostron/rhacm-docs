[#submariner]
= Submariner networking service (Technology Preview)

The `submariner-addon` component is a *Technology Preview* feature.

The _Submariner_ service is an open source tool that can be used with {product-title} to provide direct networking between pods across two or more Kubernetes clusters in your environment, either on-premises or in the cloud. For more information about Submariner, see https://submariner.io/[Submariner].

You can enable Submariner on the {ocp-short} clusters that are hosted in the following environments:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform
* Microsoft Azure
* IBM Cloud
* Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated
* VMware vSphere


{product-title} provides a Submariner component that you can deploy in your environment by using your hub cluster.

[#submariner-prereq]
== Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites before using Submariner:

* A {product-title-short} hub cluster that is running on {ocp} version 4.6, or later, with Kubernetes version 1.19, or later.
* A credential to access the hub cluster with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* Two or more {ocp-short} managed clusters that are running on {ocp-short} version 4.4, or later, with Kubernetes version 1.17, or later, and are managed by the {product-title-short} hub cluster.
* Pod and Service Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) between the clusters that do not overlap.
* IP connectivity must be configured between the Gateway nodes. When connecting two clusters, at least one of the clusters must be accessible to the Gateway node using its public or private IP address designated to the Gateway node. See https://submariner.io/operations/nat-traversal[Submariner Nat Traversal] for more information.
* Firewall configuration across all nodes in each of the managed clusters must allow 4800/UDP in both directions. 
* Firewall configuration on the Gateway nodes must allow ingress 8080/TCP so the other nodes in the cluster can access it. 
* Firewall configuration open for 4500/UDP and any other ports that are used for IPsec traffic on the gateway nodes.
+
*Note:* This is configured automatically when your clusters are deployed in an AWS or Google Cloud Platform environment, but must be configured manually for clusters on other environments and for the firewalls that protect private clouds.

[#preparing-selected-hosts-to-deploy-submariner]
== Preparing selected hosts to deploy Submariner

Before you deploy Submariner with {product-title} on Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, or Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must manually prepare the clusters on the hosting environment for the connection. The requirements are different for different hosting environments, so follow the instructions for your hosting environment.

[#preparing-azure]
=== Preparing Microsoft Azure to deploy Submariner

To prepare the clusters on your Microsoft Azure for deploying the Submariner component, complete the following steps:

. Create the inbound and outbound firewall rules on your Microsoft Azure environment to open the IP security NAT traversal ports (by default 4500/UDP) to enable Submariner communication:
+
----
# create inbound nat rule
$ az network lb inbound-nat-rule create --lb-name <lb-name> \
--resource-group <res-group> \
--name <name> \
--protocol Udp --frontend-port <ipsec-port> \
--backend-port <ipsec-port> \
--frontend-ip-name <frontend-ip-name>

# add your vm network interface to the created inbound nat rule
$ az network nic ip-config inbound-nat-rule add \
--lb-name <lb-name> --resource-group <res-group> \
--inbound-nat-rule <nat-name> \
--nic-name <nic-name> --ip-config-name <pipConfig>
----
Replace `lb-name` with your load balancer name.
+
Replace `res-group` with your resource group name.

--protocol Tcp --frontend-port 8080 --backend-port 8080 \
--frontend-ip-name <frontend-ip-name>

# add your vm network interface to the created inbound nat rule
$ az network nic ip-config inbound-nat-rule add \
--lb-name <lb-name> --resource-group <res-group> \
--inbound-nat-rule <nat-name> \
--nic-name <nic-name> --ip-config-name <pipConfig>
----
Replace `lb-name` with your load balancer name.
+
Replace `res-group` with your resource group name.
+
Replace `nat-name` with your load balancing inbound NAT rule name.
+
Replace `pipConfig` with your cluster frontend IP configuration name.
+
Replace `nic-name` with your network interface card (NIC) name.

. Create network security groups {NSG) security rules on your Azure to open a NAT traversal port (by default 4500/UDP) for Submariner:
+
----
$ az network nsg rule create --resource-group <res-group> \
--nsg-name <nsg-name> --priority <priority> \
--name <name> --direction Inbound --access Allow \
--protocol Udp --destination-port-ranges <ipsec-port>

$ az network nsg rule create --resource-group <res-group> \
--nsg-name <nsg-name> --priority <priority> \
--name <name> --direction Outbound --access Allow \
--protocol Udp --destination-port-ranges <ipsec-port>
Replace `res-group` with your resource group name.

Replace `nsg-name` with your NSG name.
+
Replace `priority` with your rule priority.
+
Replace `name` with your rule name.

----

. Create the NSG rules to open 4800/UDP port to encapsulate pod traffic from the worker and master nodes to the Submariner Gateway nodes:
+
----
$ az network nsg rule create --resource-group <res-group> \
--nsg-name <nsg-name> --priority <priority> \
--name <name> --direction Inbound --access Allow \

----
Replace `res-group` with your resource group name.
+
Replace `nsg-name` with your NSG name.
+
Replace `priority` with your rule priority.
+
Replace `name` with your rule name.

. Label a worker node in the cluster with the following label: `submariner.io/gateway=true`.

[#preparing-ibm]
=== Preparing IBM Cloud to deploy Submariner

There are two kinds of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Service (ROKS) on IBM Cloud: the classic cluster and the second generation of compute infrastructure in a virtual private cloud (VPC). Submariner cannot run on the classic ROKS cluster since cannot configure the IPsec ports for the classic cluster.

To configure the ROKS clusters on a VPC to use Submariner, complete the steps in the following links:

. Before you create a cluster, specify subnets for pods and services, which avoids overlapping CIDRs with other clusters. Make sure there are no overlapping pods and services CIDRs between clusters if you are using an existing cluster. See https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics[VPC Subnets] for the procedure. 

. Attach a public gateway to subnets used in the cluster. See https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics_pgw[Public Gateway] for the procedure. 

. Create inbound rules for the default security group of the cluster by completing the steps in https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-network-policy#security_groups_ui[Security Group]. Ensure that the firewall allows inbound and outbound traffic on 4500/UDP and 500/UDP ports for Gateway nodes, and allows inbound and outbound UDP/4800 for all the other nodes.

. Label a node that has the public gateway as `submariner.io/gateway=true` in the cluster.

. Refer to https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/calico/[Calico] to configure Calico CNI by creating IPPools in the cluster.

[#preparing-osd]
=== Preparing Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated to deploy Submariner

Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated supports clusters that were provisioned by AWS and Google Cloud Platform.

[#preparing-osd-aws]
==== Preparing Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated to deploy Submariner on AWS

To configure the AWS clusters on Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, complete the following steps:

. Submit a https://issues.redhat.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa[support ticket] to the Red Hat OpenShift Hosted SRE Support team to grant `cluster-admin` group access to the Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated cluster. The default access of `dedicated-admin` does not have the permission that is required the create a `MachineSet`.

. After the group is created, add the user name to the `cluster-admin` group that you created by completing the steps in https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/4/administering_a_cluster/cluster-admin-role.html[Granting the cluster-admin role to users] in the Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated documentation.

. Configure the credentials of the user `osdCcsAdmin`, so you can use that as a service account.  

. Import your cluster to {product-title-short}, and follow the instructions in xref:../services/deploy_submariner#deploying-submariner-console[Deploying Submariner with the console].

[#preparing-osd-gcp]
==== Preparing Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated to deploy Submariner on Google Cloud Platform

To configure the Google Cloud Platform clusters on Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, complete the following steps:

. Configure a service account named `osd-ccs-admin` that you can use to manage the deployment.

. Import your cluster to {product-title-short}, and follow the instructions in xref:../services/deploy_submariner.adoc#deploying-submariner-console[Deploying Submariner with the console].
