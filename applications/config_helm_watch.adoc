[#helm-watch-config]
= Configuring Helm to watch namespace resources

By default, when a subscription deploys subscribed Helm resources to target clusters, the application resources are watched. You can configure the Helm channel type to watch namespace-scoped resources. When enabled, manual changes to those watched namespace-scoped resources are reverted.

[#configure-watch]
== Configuring 

**Required access:** Cluster administrator

To configure the Helm application to watch namespace scoped resources, set the value for the `watchHelmNamespaceScopedResources` field in your subscription definition to `true`. See the following sample.
