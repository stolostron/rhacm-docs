= Configuring Helm to watch namespace resources

By default, when a subscription deploys subscribed Helm resources to target clusters, the application resources are watched. You can configure the Helm channel type to watch namespace-scoped resources. When enabled, manual changes to those watched namespace-scoped resources are reverted.
