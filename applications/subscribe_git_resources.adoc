[#subscribing-git-resources]
= Subscribing Git resources 

By default, when a subscription deploys subscribed applications to target clusters, the applications are deployed to that subscription namespace, even if the application resources are associated with other namespaces. A _subscription_ administrator can change default behavior, as described in xref:../applications/subscription_admin.adoc#granting-subscription-admin-privilege[Granting subscription admin privilege].

Additionally, if an application resource exists in the cluster and was not created by the subscription, the subscription cannot apply a new resource on that existing resource. See the following processes to change default settings as the subscription administrator:

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#creating-application-resources-git]
== Creating application resources in Git

You need to specify the full group and version for `apiVersion` in resource YAML when you subscribe. For example, if you subscribe to `apiVersion: v1`, the subscription controller fails to validate the subscription and you receive an error: `Resource /v1, Kind=ImageStream is not supported`. 

If the `apiVersion` is changed to `image.openshift.io/v1`, as in the following sample, it passes the validation in the subscription controller and the resource is applied successfully.
 
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: `image.openshift.io/v1`
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
spec:
  lookupPolicy:
    local: true
  tags:
    - name: 'latest'
      from:
        kind: DockerImage
        name: 'quay.io/repository/open-cluster-management/multicluster-operators-subscription:community-latest'

Next, see more useful examples of how a subscription administrator can change default behavior.

[#namespace-example]
== Application namespace example

In this following examples, you are logged in as a subscription administrator. 

[#different-namespace]
=== Application to different namespaces

Create a subscription to subscribe the sample resource YAML file from a Git repository. The example file contains subscriptions that are located within the following different namespaces:

*Applicable channel types:* Git

* ConfigMap `test-configmap-1` gets created in `multins` namespace. 

* ConfigMap `test-configmap-2` gets created in `default` namespace.

* ConfigMap `test-configmap-3` gets created in the `subscription` namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: multins
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: multins
data:
  path: resource1
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-2
  namespace: default
data:
  path: resource2
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-3
data:
  path: resource3
----

If the subscription was created by other users, all the ConfigMaps get created in the same namespace as the subscription.

[#same-namespace]
=== Application to same namespace

As a subscription administrator, you might want to deploy all application resources into the same namespace. 

You can deploy all application resources into the subscription namespace by xref:../applications/allow_deny.adoc#creating-allow-deny-list[Creating an allow and deny list as subscription administrator].

Add `apps.open-cluster-management.io/current-namespace-scoped: true` annotation to the subscription YAML. For example, when a subscription administrator creates the following subscription, all three ConfigMaps in the previous example are created in `subscription-ns` namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: subscription-example
  namespace: subscription-ns
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: sample-resources
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: merge
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/current-namespace-scoped: "true"
spec:
  channel: channel-ns/somechannel
  placement:
    placementRef:
      name: dev-clusters
----

[#resource-overwrite-example]
== Resource overwrite example

*Applicable channel types:* Git, ObjectBucket (Object storage in the console)

In this example, the following ConfigMap already exists in the target cluster. 

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  name: user1
  age: 19
----

Subscribe the following sample resource YAML file from a Git repository and replace the existing ConfigMap. See the change in the `data` specification:


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  age: 20
----

[#default-merge-option]
=== Default merge option

See the following sample resource YAML file from a Git repository with the default `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: merge` annotation. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: subscription-example
  namespace: sub-ns
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: sample-resources
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: merge
spec:
  channel: channel-ns/somechannel
  placement:
    placementRef:
      name: dev-clusters
----

When this subscription is created by a subscription administrator and subscribes the ConfigMap resource, the existing ConfigMap is merged, as you can see in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  name: user1
  age: 20
----

When the `merge` option is used, entries from subscribed resource are either created or updated in the existing resource. No entry is removed from the existing resource.

*Important:* If the existing resource you want to overwrite with a subscription is automatically reconciled by another operator or controller, the resource configuration is updated by both subscription and the controller or operator. Do not use this method in this case.

[#replace-option]
=== Replace option

You log in as a subscription administrator and create a subscription with `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: replace` annotation. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: subscription-example
  namespace: sub-ns
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: sample-resources
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: replace
spec:
  channel: channel-ns/somechannel
  placement:
    placementRef:
      name: dev-clusters
----

When this subscription is created by a subscription administrator and subscribes the ConfigMap resource, the existing ConfigMap is replaced by the following:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  age: 20
----

[#subscribing-specific-git]
== Subscribing specific Git elements

You can subscribe to a specific Git branch, commit, or tag.

[#subscribing-specific-branch]
=== Subscribing to a specific branch

The subscription operator that is included in the `multicloud-operators-subscription` repository subscribes to the `master` branch of a Git repository by default. If you want to subscribe to a different branch, you need to specify the branch name annotation in the subscription.

The following example, the YAML file displays how to specify a different branch with `apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-branch: <branch1>`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: git-mongodb-subscription
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: stable/ibm-mongodb-dev
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-branch: <branch1>
----

[#subscribing-specific-commit]
=== Subscribing to a specific commit

The subscription operator that is included in the `multicloud-operators-subscription` repository subscribes to the latest commit of specified branch of a Git repository by default. If you want to subscribe to a specific commit, you need to specify the desired commit annotation with the commit hash in the subscription.

The following example, the YAML file displays how to specify a different commit with `apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-desired-commit: <full commit number>`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: git-mongodb-subscription
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: stable/ibm-mongodb-dev
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-desired-commit: <full commit number>
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-clone-depth: 100
----

The `git-clone-depth` annotation is optional and set to `20` by default, which means the subscription controller retrieves the previous 20 commit histories from the Git repository. If you specify a much older `git-desired-commit`, you need to specify `git-clone-depth` accordingly for the desired commit.

[#subscribing-specific-tag]
=== Subscribing to a specific tag

The subscription operator that is included in the `multicloud-operators-subscription` repository subscribes to the latest commit of specified branch of a Git repository by default. If you want to subscribe to a specific tag, you need to specify the tag annotation in the subscription.

The following example, the YAML file displays how to specify a different tag with `apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-tag: <v1.0>`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: git-mongodb-subscription
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: stable/ibm-mongodb-dev
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-tag: <v1.0>
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-clone-depth: 100
----

*Note:* If both Git desired commit and tag annotations are specified, the tag is ignored.

The `git-clone-depth` annotation is optional and set to `20` by default, which means the subscription controller retrieves the previous `20` commit history from the Git repository. If you specify much older `git-tag`, you need to specify `git-clone-depth` accordingly for the desired commit of the tag.
