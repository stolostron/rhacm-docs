[#subscribing-git-resources]
= Subscribing Git resources 

By default, when a subscription deploys subscribed applications to target clusters, the applications are deployed to that subscription namespace, even if the application resources are associated with other namespaces. A _subscription_ administrator can change default behavior, as described in this topic.

Additionally, if an application resource exists in the cluster and was not created by the subscription, the subscription cannot apply a new resource on that existing resource. See the following processes to change default settings as the subscription administrator:

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#granting-users-and-groups-subscription-admin-privilege]
== Granting users and groups subscription administrator 

Learn how to grant subscription administrator access.

. From the console, log in to your {ocp} cluster.

. Create one or more users. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/post_installation_configuration/preparing-for-users.html[Preparing for users] for information about creating users.

+
Users that you create are administrators for the `app.open-cluster-management.io/subscription` application. With {ocp-short}, a _subscription_ administrator can change default behavior. You can group these users to represent a subscription administrative group, which is demonstrated in later examples.

. From the terminal, log in to your {product-title-short} cluster.

. If `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding does not exist, you need to create it. See the following example:

+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
----

. Add the following subjects into `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding with the following command:

+
----
oc edit clusterrolebinding open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
----

+

*Note:* Initially, `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding has no subject.

+
Your subjects might display as the following example:
+

[source,yaml]
----
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: example-name
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: example-group-name
----

[#creating-allow-deny-list]
== Creating an allow and deny list for subscriptions
 
As a user in a `subscription-admin` role, you can create an application from a Git repository application subscription that contains an `allow` list to allow deployment of `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1` resources. You can also create a `deny` list in the application subscription to allow deployment of only specific resources.

By default, every user that can add resources to Git becomes a `cluster-admin` by adding policies. To avoid this default behavior, application subscription needs the following criteria:

- The application is deployed by a user with `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` role.
- The application subscription contains `allow` list to allow deployment of `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1` resources.

See the following example of `allow` and `deny` specifications:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/github-path: sub2
  name: demo-subscription
  namespace: demo-ns
spec:
  channel: demo-ns/somechannel
  allow:
  - apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
    kinds:
    - Policy
  - apiVersion: v1
    kinds:
    - Deployment
  deny:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kinds:
    - Service
    - ConfigMap
  placement:
    local: true
----

The following application subscription YAML specifies that when the application is deployed from the `myapplication` directory from the source repository, it deploys only `v1/Deployment` resources, even if there are other resources in the source repository:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/github-path: myapplication
  name: demo-subscription
  namespace: demo-ns
spec:
  channel: demo-ns/somechannel
  deny:
  - apiVersion: v1
     kinds:
      - Service
      - ConfigMap
  placement:
    placementRef:
      name: demo-placement
      kind: PlacementRule
----

This example application subscription YAML specifies deployments of all valid resources except `v1/Service` and `v1/ConfigMap` resources. Instead of listing individual resource kinds under an  API group, you can just add `"*"` to allow or deny all resource kinds in the API Group.

[#creating-application-resources-git]
== Creating application resources in Git

You need to specify the full group and version for `apiVersion` in resource YAML when you subscribe. For example, if you subscribe to `apiVersion: v1`, the subscription controller fails to validate the subscription and you receive an error: `Resource /v1, Kind=ImageStream is not supported`. 

If the `apiVersion` is changed to `image.openshift.io/v1`, as in the following sample, it passes the validation in the subscription controller and the resource is applied successfully.
 
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: `image.openshift.io/v1`
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
spec:
  lookupPolicy:
    local: true
  tags:
    - name: 'latest'
      from:
        kind: DockerImage
        name: 'quay.io/repository/open-cluster-management/multicluster-operators-subscription:community-latest'
----

Next, see more useful examples of how a subscription administrator can change default behavior.

[#namespace-example]
== Application namespace example

In this example, you are logged in as a subscription administrator. Create a subscription to subscribe the sample resource YAML file from a Git repository. The example file contains subscriptions that are located within the following different namespaces:

*Applicable channel types:* Git

* ConfigMap `test-configmap-1` gets created in `multins` namespace. 

* ConfigMap `test-configmap-2` gets created in `default` namespace.

* ConfigMap `test-configmap-3` gets created in the `subscription` namespace.
+

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: multins
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: multins
data:
  path: resource1
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-2
  namespace: default
data:
  path: resource2
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-3
data:
  path: resource3
----

If the subscription was created by other users, all the ConfigMaps get created in the same namespace as the subscription.

[#resource-overwrite-example]
== Resource overwrite example

*Applicable channel types:* Git, ObjectBucket (Object storage in the console)

In this example, the following ConfigMap already exists in the target cluster. 


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  name: user1
  age: 19
----

Subscribe the following sample resource YAML file from a Git repository and replace the existing ConfigMap. See the change in the `data` specification:


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  age: 20
----

[#default-merge-option]
=== Default merge option

See the following sample resource YAML file from a Git repository with the default `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: merge` annotation. See the following example:


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: subscription-example
  namespace: sub-ns
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: sample-resources
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: merge
spec:
  channel: channel-ns/somechannel
  placement:
    placementRef:
      name: dev-clusters
----

When this subscription is created by a subscription administrator and subscribes the ConfigMap resource, the existing ConfigMap is merged, as you can see in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  name: user1
  age: 20
----

When the `merge` option is used, entries from subscribed resource are either created or updated in the existing resource. No entry is removed from the existing resource.

*Important:* If the existing resource you want to overwrite with a subscription is automatically reconciled by another operator or controller, the resource configuration is updated by both subscription and the controller or operator. Do not use this method in this case.

[#replace-option]
=== Replace option

You log in as a subscription administrator and create a subscription with `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: replace` annotation. See the following example:


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: subscription-example
  namespace: sub-ns
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: sample-resources
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: replace
spec:
  channel: channel-ns/somechannel
  placement:
    placementRef:
      name: dev-clusters
----

When this subscription is created by a subscription administrator and subscribes the ConfigMap resource, the existing ConfigMap is replaced by the following:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  age: 20
----

[#subscribing-specific-git]
== Subscribing specific Git elements

You can subscribe to a specific Git branch, commit, or tag.

[#subscribing-specific-branch]
=== Subscribing to a specific branch

The subscription operator that is included in the `multicloud-operators-subscription` repository subscribes to the `master` branch of a Git repository by default. If you want to subscribe to a different branch, you need to specify the branch name annotation in the subscription.

The following example, the YAML file displays how to specify a different branch with `apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-branch: <branch1>`:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: git-mongodb-subscription
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: stable/ibm-mongodb-dev
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-branch: <branch1>
----

[#subscribing-specific-commit]
=== Subscribing to a specific commit

The subscription operator that is included in the `multicloud-operators-subscription` repository subscribes to the latest commit of specified branch of a Git repository by default. If you want to subscribe to a specific commit, you need to specify the desired commit annotation with the commit hash in the subscription.

The following example, the YAML file displays how to specify a different commit with `apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-desired-commit: <full commit number>`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: git-mongodb-subscription
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: stable/ibm-mongodb-dev
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-desired-commit: <full commit number>
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-clone-depth: 100
----

The `git-clone-depth` annotation is optional and set to `20` by default, which means the subscription controller retrieves the previous 20 commit histories from the Git repository. If you specify a much older `git-desired-commit`, you need to specify `git-clone-depth` accordingly for the desired commit.

[#subscribing-specific-tag]
=== Subscribing to a specific tag

The subscription operator that is included in the `multicloud-operators-subscription` repository subscribes to the latest commit of specified branch of a Git repository by default. If you want to subscribe to a specific tag, you need to specify the tag annotation in the subscription.

The following example, the YAML file displays how to specify a different tag with `apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-tag: <v1.0>`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: git-mongodb-subscription
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: stable/ibm-mongodb-dev
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-tag: <v1.0>
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-clone-depth: 100
----

*Note:* If both Git desired commit and tag annotations are specified, the tag is ignored.

The `git-clone-depth` annotation is optional and set to `20` by default, which means the subscription controller retrieves the previous `20` commit history from the Git repository. If you specify much older `git-tag`, you need to specify `git-clone-depth` accordingly for the desired commit of the tag.
