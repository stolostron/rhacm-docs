[#application-model-and-definitions]
= Application model and definitions

The application model is based on subscribing to one or more Kubernetes resource repositories (_channel_ resources) that contains resources that are deployed on managed clusters. Both single and multicluster applications use the same Kubernetes specifications, but multicluster applications involve more automation of the deployment and application management lifecycle.

See the following image to understand more about the application model:

[#applications]
== Applications

Applications (`application.app.k8s.io`) in {product-title} are used for grouping Kubernetes resources that make up an application.

All of the application component resources for {product-title} applications are defined in YAML file spec sections. When you need to create or update an application component resource, you need to create or edit the appropriate spec section to include the labels for defining your resource. 

You can also work with _Discovered_ applications, which are applications that are discovered by the {ocp-short} GitOps or an Argo CD operator that is installed in your clusters. Applications that share the same repository are grouped together in this view.

[#subscriptions]
== Subscriptions

Subscriptions (`subscription.apps.open-cluster-management.io`) allow clusters to subscribe to a source repository (channel) that can be the following types: Git repository, Helm release registry, or Object storage repository. 

*Note:* Self-managing the hub cluster is not recommended because the resources might impact the hub cluster. 

Subscriptions can deploy application resources locally to the hub cluster, if the hub cluster is self-managed. You can then view the `local-cluster` subscription in the topology. Resource requirements might adversely impact hub cluster performance.

Subscriptions can point to a channel or storage location for identifying new or updated resource templates. The subscription operator can then download directly from the storage location and deploy to targeted managed clusters without checking the hub cluster first. With a subscription, the subscription operator can monitor the channel for new or updated resources instead of the hub cluster.

See the following subscription architecture image:

[#channels]
=== Channels

Channels (`channel.apps.open-cluster-management.io`) define the source repositories that a cluster can subscribe to with a subscription, and can be the following types: Git, Helm release, and Object storage repositories, and resource templates on the hub cluster.

If you have applications that require Kubernetes resources or Helm charts from channels that require authorization, such as entitled Git repositories, you can use secrets to provide access to these channels. Your subscriptions can access Kubernetes resources and Helm charts for deployment from these channels, while maintaining data security.

Channels use a namespace within the hub cluster and point to a physical place where resources are stored for deployment. Clusters can subscribe to channels for identifying the resources to deploy to each cluster.

**Notes:** It is best practice to create each channel in a unique namespace. However, a Git channel can share a namespace with another type of channel, including Git, Helm, and Object storage.

Resources within a channel can be accessed by only the clusters that subscribe to that channel.

[#placement-rules]
=== Placement rules

Placement rules (`placementrule.apps.open-cluster-management.io`) define the target clusters where resource templates can be deployed. Use placement rules to help you facilitate the multicluster deployment of your deployables. Placement rules are also used for governance and risk policies. For more information on how, see link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance].

[#applicationset]
== ApplicationSet (Technology Preview)

`ApplicationSet` (Technology Preview) is a sub-project of Argo CD that adds multicluster support for Argo CD applications. You can create an ApplicationSet from the product console editor.
