= Managing application resources

From the console, you can create applications by using Git repositories, Helm repositories, and Object storage repositories.

**Important:** 

- Git Channels can share a namespace with all other channel types: Helm, Object storage, and other Git namespaces.

- To configure a proxy server while managing applications, see link:../add-ons/cluster_wide_proxy.adoc#enable-cluster-wide-proxy-addon[Enabling and disabling cluster-wide proxy on add-ons].
