[#setting-up-ansible]
= {aap-short} integration and introduction 

{product-title-short} is integrated with {aap} so that you can create prehook and posthook AnsibleJob instances for Git subscription application management. 

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#ansible-integration]
== Integration and components

You can integrate {aap-short} jobs into Git subscriptions. For instance, for a database front-end and back-end application, the database is required to be instantiated using {aap-short} with an Ansible Job, and the application is installed by a Git subscription. The database is instantiated _before_ you deploy the front-end and back-end application with the subscription.

The application subscription operator is enhanced to define two subfolders: `prehook` and `posthook`. Both folders are in the Git repository resource root path and contain all prehook and posthook Ansible jobs, respectively.

When the Git subscription is created, all of the pre and post AnsibleJob resources are parsed and stored in memory as an object. The application subscription controller decides when to create the pre and post AnsibleJob instances.

When you create a subscription CR, the Git-branch and Git-path points to a Git repository root location. In the Git root location, the two subfolders `prehook` and `posthook` should contain at least one `Kind:AnsibleJob` resource.

[#prehook]
=== Prehook

The application subscription controller searches all the `Kind:AnsibleJob` CRs in the prehook folder as the prehook AnsibleJob objects, then generates a new prehook AnsibleJob instance. The new instance name is the prehook AnsibleJob object name and a random suffix string. 

See an example instance name: `database-sync-1-2913063`.

The application subscription controller queues the reconcile request again in a 1 minute loop, where it checks the prehook AnsibleJob `status.ansibleJobResult`. When the prehook `status.ansibleJobResult.status` is `successful`, the application subscription continues to deploy the main subscription.

[#posthook]
=== Posthook

When the app subscription status is updated, if the subscription status is subscribed or propagated to all target clusters in subscribed status, the app subscription controller searches all of the `AnsibleJob` `Kind` CRs in the posthook folder as the posthook AnsibleJob objects. Then, it generates new posthook `AnsibleJob` instances. The new instance name is the posthook `AnsibleJob` object name and a random suffix string. 

See an example instance name: `service-ticket-1-2913849`.

[#ansible-placement-rule]
=== Ansible placement rules

With a valid prehook AnsibleJob, the subscription launches the prehook AnsibleJob regardless of the decision from the placement rule. For example, you can have a prehook AnsibleJob that failed to propagate a placement rule subscription. When the placement rule decision changes, new prehook and posthook AnsibleJob instances are created.
