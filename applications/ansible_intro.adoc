[#aap-intro]
= {aap-short} integration and introduction 

{acm-short} is integrated with {aap} so that you can create prehook and posthook `AnsibleJob` instances for Git subscription application management. Learn about the components and how to configure {aap-short}.

== Integration and components

You can integrate {aap-short} jobs into Git subscriptions. For instance, for a database front end and back end application, the database is required to be instantiated by using {aap-short} with an {aap-short} Job. The application is installed by a Git subscription. The database is instantiated _before_ you deploy the front end and back end application with the subscription.

The application subscription operator is enhanced to define two subfolders named `prehook` and `posthook`. Both folders are in the Git repository resource root path and contain all prehook and posthook {aap-short} jobs, respectively.

When the Git subscription is created, all of the prehook and posthook `AnsibleJob` resources are parsed and stored in memory as an object. The application subscription controller decides when to create the prehook and posthook `AnsibleJob` instances.

When you create a subscription custom resource, the Git branch and Git path points to a Git repository root location. In the Git root location, the two subfolders `prehook` and `posthook` should contain at least one `Kind:AnsibleJob` resource.

[#prehook]
=== Prehook

The application subscription controller searches all the `kind:AnsibleJob` CRs in the prehook folder as the prehook `AnsibleJob` objects, then generates a new prehook `AnsibleJob` instance. The new instance name is the prehook `AnsibleJob` object name and a random suffix string. 

See the following example instance name: `database-sync-1-2913063`.

The application subscription controller queues the reconcile request again in a one minute loop, where it checks the prehook `AnsibleJob` `status.AnsibleJobResult`. When the prehook status is `successful`, the application subscription continues to deploy the main subscription.

[#posthook]
=== Posthook

When the application subscription status is updated, if the subscription status is subscribed or propagated to all target clusters in subscribed status, the application subscription controller searches all of the `AnsibleJob` `kind` custom resources in the posthook folder as the posthook `AnsibleJob` objects. Then, it generates new posthook `AnsibleJob` instances. The new instance name is the posthook `AnsibleJob` object name and a random suffix string. 

See the following example instance name: `service-ticket-1-2913849`.
