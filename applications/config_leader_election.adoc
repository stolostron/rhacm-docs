[#config_leader_election]
= Configuring leader election

With `LeaderElection`, you can change how the controllers make requests to choose a new leader in case of a failure, which ensures only one leader instance handles the reconciliation at a time. You can increase or decrease the amount of time a controller takes to acquire `LeaderElection`. With decreased time, a new leader is chosen quicker during a failure. 

*Note:* Changes to the default values for the controllers might impact system performance during that task. You can reduce your `etcd` load by changing the default values for `leaseDuration`, `renewDeadline`, or `retryPeriod` of controllers.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#controller-change]
== Editing the controller flag

To configure `LeaderElection`, you change the following default values:

- `leader-election-lease-duration: 137 seconds`
- `renew-deadline: 107 seconds`
- `retry-period: 26 seconds`

See the following steps to change the `multicluster-operators-application`, `multicluster-operators-channel`, `multicluster-operators-standalone-subscription`, or `multicluster-operators-hub-subscription` controllers:

. Run the following command to pause your `multiclusterhub`:
+
----
oc annotate mch -n open-cluster-management multiclusterhub mch-pause=true --overwrite=true
----

. Edit the `deployment` file by adding the controller's name to the `oc edit` command. See the following example command:

+
----
oc edit deployment -n open-cluster-management multicluster-operators-hub-subscription
----

. Locate the controller command flags by searching for `- command`.

. From the containers section in the controller, insert a `- command` flag. For instance, insert `RetryPeriod`.

. Save the file. The controller automatically restarts to apply the flag. 

. Repeat this procedure for each controller that you want to change.

. Run the following command to resume your `multiclusterhub`:
----
oc annotate mch -n open-cluster-management multiclusterhub mch-pause=false --overwrite=true
----

See the following example output of a successful edit to the `-command`, where the `retryPeriod` flag doubles the previously mentioned default time to `52`, which is allotted to retry acquiring `leaderElection`:

----
command:

- --retry-period=52
