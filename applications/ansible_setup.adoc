= Setting up {aap-short}

With {aap-short} jobs, you can automate tasks and integrate with external services, such as Slack and PagerDuty services. Your Git repository resource root path will contain `prehook` and `posthook` directories for {aap-short} jobs that run as part of deploying the application, updating the application, or removing the application from a cluster.

[#prerequisites-for-ansible-integration]
== Prerequisites 

* Install {ocp-short} {ocp-latest} or later.

* Install {aap-short}. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation.html[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform] documenation to install the latest supported version.

* Install the {aap-short} Resource Operator to connect {aap-short} jobs to the lifecycle of Git subscriptions. *Best practice:* The {aap-short} job template should be idempotent when it is run. 

* Check `PROMPT ON LAUNCH` on the template for both `INVENTORY` and `EXTRA VARIABLES`. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html[Job templates] for more information.
