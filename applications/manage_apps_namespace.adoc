[#managing-apps-with-namespace-repositories]
= Managing apps with Namespace repositories

When you deploy Kubernetes resources using an application, the resources are located in specific repositories. Learn how to deploy resources that are available in the Namespace within a specific Namespace in the following procedure. Learn more about the application model at xref:../applications/app_model.adoc#application-model-and-definitions[Application model and definitions].

*User required access:* A user role that can create applications. You can only perform actions that your role is assigned. Learn about access requirements from the link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] documentation. 

. From the console navigation menu, click *Manage applications*.

. Click *Create application*.

+
For the following steps, select *YAML: On* to view the YAML in the console as you create your application. See YAML samples later in the topic.

. Enter the following values in the correct fields:
+
* Name: Enter an application name. This name can be any value.
* Namespace: Select a namespace from the list or create one, depending on user access role.

. Choose *Namespace* from the list of repositories that you can use.

. Enter the required URL path or select an existing path.

+
If you select an existing Namespace repository path, you do not need to specify connection information if this is a private repository. The connection information is pre-set and you do not need to view these values. 

+
If you enter a new Namespace repository path, you can optionally enter Namespace connection information if this is a private Namespace repository.

. Enter values for the optional fields.
 
. Set any optional pre and post-deployment tasks. 
 
. From _Settings_, you can specify application behavior. To block or activate changes to your deployment during a specific time window, choose an option for _Deployment window_ and your _Time window configuration_.

. You can either choose another repository or Click *Save*.

. You are redirected to the _Overview_ page where you can view the details and topology.

[#sample-yaml-namespace]
== Sample YAML

To create resources correctly, add the following two labels that are required in the deployable to the subscription controller that identifies which deployable resources are added:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/channel: <channel name>
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/channel-type: Namespace
----

Don't specify template namespace in each resource template `spec.template.metadata.namespace`. 

For the namespace type channel and subscription, all the templates are deployed to the subscription namespace on managed clusters. As a result, those templates that are defined outside of the subscription namespace are skipped.

The following example channel definitions abstracts a namespace as a channel that holds deployable resources. When this YAML is applied, a namespace `ch-qa` is created for the channel that is named `qa`. The channel controller maintains the resources at the actual namespace location and ensures that the resources are kept up-to-date.

[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
  kind: Channel
  metadata:
    name: qa
    namespace: ch-qa
  spec:
    sourceNamespaces:
    - default
    type: Namespace
    pathname: ch-qa
    gates:
      annotations:
        dev-ready: approved
