[#managing-apps-with-object-storage-repositories]
= Managing apps with Object storage repositories

When you deploy Kubernetes resources using an application, the resources are located in specific repositories. Learn more about the application model at xref:../applications/app_model.adoc#application-model-and-definitions[Application model and definitions]:

*User required access:* A user role that can create applications. You can only perform actions that your role is assigned. Learn about access requirements from the link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] documentation. 

. From the console navigation menu, click *Applications* to see listed applications and to create new applications.

. *Optional:* After you choose the kind of application you want to create, you can select *YAML: On* to view the YAML in the console as you create and edit your application. See the YAML samples later in the topic.

. Choose *Object store* from the list of repositories that you can use and enter the values in the correct fields. Follow the guidance in the console and see the YAML editor change values based on your input.

. Click *Create*.

. You are redirected to the _Overview_ page where you can view the details and topology.

[#sample-yaml-object]
== Sample YAML

The following example channel definition abstracts an object storage as a channel:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
 name: dev
 namespace: ch-obj
spec:
 type: Object storage
 pathname: [http://sample-ip:#####/dev] # URL is appended with the valid bucket name, which matches the channel name.
 secretRef:
   name: miniosecret
 gates:
   annotations:
     dev-ready: true
----

*Note:* To see REST API, use the link:../apis/api.adoc#apis[APIs].
 
[#creating-aws-object-bucket]
== Creating your Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 object storage bucket

You can set up subscriptions to subscribe resources that are defined in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) object storage service. See the following procedure:
//I cannot check this, do we want to continue with this content even though the process in their product may change? If so, please check this?

. Log into the https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/[AWS console] with your AWS account, user name, and password.

. Navigate to *Amazon S3* > *Buckets* to the bucket home page.

. Click *Create Bucket* to create your bucket.

. Select the *AWS region*, which is essential for connecting your AWS S3 object bucket.

. Create the bucket access token.

. Navigate to your user name in the navigation bar, then from the drop-down menu, select *My Security Credentials*.

. Navigate to _Access keys for CLI, SDK, & API access_ in the _AWS IAM credentials_ tab and click on *Create access key*.

. Save your _Access key ID_ , _Secret access key_. 
 
. Upload your object YAML files to the bucket.

[#subscribing-to-aws-bucket]
== Subscribing to the object in the AWS bucket

. Create an object bucket type channel with a secret to specify the _AccessKeyID_, _SecretAccessKey_, and _Region_ for connecting the AWS bucket. The three fields are created when the AWS bucket is created.

. Add the URL. The URL identifies the channel in a AWS S3 bucket if the URL contains `s3://` or `s3 and aws` keywords. For example, see all of the following bucket URLs have AWS s3 bucket identifiers:

+
----
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/sample-bucket-1
s3://sample-bucket-1/
https://sample-bucket-1.s3.amazonaws.com/
----

+
*Note:* The AWS S3 object bucket URL is not necessary to connect the bucket with the AWS S3 API. 

[#sample-aws-subscription]
== Sample AWS subscription

See the following complete AWS S3 object bucket channel sample YAML file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: object-dev
  namespace: ch-object-dev
spec:
  type: ObjectBucket
  pathname: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/sample-bucket-1
  secretRef:
    name: secret-dev
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-dev
  namespace: ch-object-dev
stringData:
  AccessKeyID: <your AWS bucket access key id>
  SecretAccessKey: <your AWS bucket secret access key>
  Region: <your AWS  bucket region>
type: Opaque
----

You can continue to create other AWS subscription and placement rule objects, as you see in the following sample YAML with `kind: PlacementRule` and `kind: Subscription` added:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementRule
metadata:
  name: towhichcluster
  namespace: obj-sub-ns
spec:
  clusterSelector: {}
---
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: obj-sub
  namespace: obj-sub-ns
spec:
  channel: ch-object-dev/object-dev
  placement:
    placementRef:
      kind: PlacementRule
      name: towhichcluster
----

You can also subscribe to objects within a specific subfolder in the object bucket. Add the `subfolder` annotation to the subscription, which forces the object bucket subscription to only apply all the resources in the subfolder path. 

See the annotation with `subfolder-1` as the `bucket-path`:

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  apps.open-cluster-management.io/bucket-path: <subfolder-1>
----

See the following complete sample for a subfolder:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/bucket-path: subfolder1
  name: obj-sub
  namespace: obj-sub-ns
  labels:
    name: obj-sub
spec:
  channel: ch-object-dev/object-dev
  placement:
    placementRef:
      kind: PlacementRule
      name: towhichcluster
----
