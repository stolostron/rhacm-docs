= Application advanced configuration

Within {product-title}, applications are composed of multiple application resources. You can use channel, subscription, placements, and placement rule resources to help you deploy, update, and manage your overall applications.

Both single and multicluster applications use the same Kubernetes specifications, but multicluster applications involve more automation of the deployment and application management lifecycle.

All of the application component resources for {product-title} applications are defined in YAML file specification sections.
When you need to create or update an application component resource, you need to create or edit the appropriate section to include the labels for defining your resource.
