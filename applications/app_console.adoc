[#application-console]
= Application console

The console includes a dashboard for managing the application lifecycle. You can use the console dashboard to create and manage applications and view the status of applications. Enhanced capabilities help your developers and operations personnel create, deploy, update, manage, and visualize applications across your clusters. 

See some of the console capability in the following list and see the console for guided information about terms, actions, and how to read the Topology:

*Important:* Available actions are based on your assigned role. Learn about access requirements from the link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] documentation.

* Visualize deployed applications across your clusters, including any associated resource repositories, subscriptions, and placement configurations.

* Create and edit applications, and subscribe resources. From the _Actions_ menu, you can search, edit, or delete. Ensure you select `YAML:On` to view and edit the YAML as you update the fields.

* From the main _Overview_ tab, you can click an application name to view details and application resources, including resource repositories, subscriptions, placements, placement rules, and deployed resources such as any optional predeployment and postdeployment hooks that are using {aap-short} tasks (for Git repositories). You can also create an application from the overview.

* Create and view applications, such as _ApplicationSet_, _Subscription_, _OpenShift_, _Flux_, and _Argo CD_ types. An `ApplicationSet` represents Argo applications that are generated from the controller. 

    - For an ArgoCD `ApplicationSet` to be created, you need to enable `Automatically sync when cluster state changes` from the `Sync policy`.

    - For Flux with the `kustomization` controller, find Kubernetes resources with the label `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name=<app_name>`.
    
    - For Flux with the `helm` controller, find Kubernetes resources with the label `helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name=<app_name>`.
    
* *Note:* You need GitOps cluster resources and the GitOps operator installed to create an `ApplicationSet`. Without these prerequisites, you will see no *Argo server* options in the console to create an `ApplicationSet`.

* From the main _Overview_, when you click on an application name in the table to view a single application overview, you can see the following information:

* Cluster details, such as resource status
* Resource topology
* Subscription details
* Access to the Editor tab to edit

* Click the _Topology_ tab for visual representation of all the applications and resources in your project. For Helm subscriptions, see xref:../applications/package_overrides.adoc#configuring-package-overrides[Configuring package overrides] to define the appropriate `packageName` and the `packageAlias` to get an accurate topology display.

* Click the *Advanced configuration* tab to view terminology and tables of resources for all applications. You can find resources and you can filter subscriptions, placement, placement rules, and channels. If you have access, you can also click multiple *Actions*, such as Edit, Search, and Delete.

* View a successful {aap-short} deployment if you are using Ansible tasks as prehook or posthook for the deployed application. 

* Click *Launch resource in Search* to search for related resources.

* Use _Search_ to find application resources by the component `kind` for each resource. To search for resources, use the following values:

+
|===
| Application resource | Kind (search parameter)

| Subscription
| `Subscription`

| Channel
| `Channel`

| Secret
| `Secret`

| Placement
| `Placement`

| Placement rule
| `PlacementRule`

| Application
| `Application`

|===

You can also search by other fields, including name, namespace, cluster, label, and more. For more information about using search, see link:../observability/search_intro.adoc#searching-in-the-console-intro[Searching in the console introduction].
