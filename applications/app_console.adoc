[#application-console]
= Application console

The console includes a dashboard for managing the application lifecycle. You can use the console dashboard to create and manage applications and view the status of applications. Enhanced capabilities help your developers and operations personnel create, deploy, update, manage, and visualize applications across your clusters. 

See the following application console capabilities:

*Important:* Available actions are based on your assigned role. Learn about access requirements from the link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] documentation.

* Visualize deployed applications across your clusters, including any associated resource repositories, subscriptions, and placement configurations.

* Create and edit applications, and subscribe resources. By default, the hub cluster can manage itself and is named the `local cluster`. You can choose to deploy application resources to this local cluster, though deploying applications on the local cluster is not best practice. 

* From the _Overview_, click an application to view topology, which encompasses application resources, including resource repositories, subscriptions, placement rules, and deployed resources, including any optional pre deployment and post deployment hooks using Ansible Tower tasks (for Git repositories).

* Use `Advanced configuration` to view or edit subscriptions, placement rules, and channels.

* View individual status in the context of an application, including deployments, updates, and subscriptions.

The console includes tools that each provide different application management capabilities. These capabilities allow you to easily create, find, update, and deploy application resources.

[#applications-overview]
== Applications overview

From the main _Overview_ tab, see the following:

* A table that lists all applications
* The _Search_ box to filter the applications that are listed
* The application name and namespace
* The number of remote and local clusters where resources are deployed through a subscription, including Argo applications
* The links to repositories where the definitions for the resources that are deployed by the application are located
* An indication of time window constraints, if any were created
* The date when the application was created
* More actions that are available for your assigned role
* Application sets are displayed from the console:
    - An `ApplicationSet` represents Argo applications that are generated from the `ApplicationSet` controller:
    - From the Overview details, click *View application set*.
    - Click to view the *Application set YAML*.
    - If an app was generated from an `ApplicationSet`, it is only grouped with apps that were generated by the same set, even when other apps may deploy the same resources. 
    - Apps are grouped by resource if not deployed by an `ApplicationSet`.

[#single-applications-overview]
=== Single applications overview

Click on an application name in the table to view details about a single application. See the following information:

* Cluster details, such as resource status.
* Subscription details
* Resource topology
* Actions such as *Launch Argo editor*

The *Editor* tab is only available for {product-title-short} applications. Click to edit your application and related resources.

[#resource-topology]
== Resource topology

The topology provides a visual representation of the application that was selected including the resources deployed by this application on target clusters.

* You can select any component from the Topology view to view more details.

* View the deployment details for any resource deployed by this application by clicking on the resource node to open the properties view.

* If you selected Argo applications, you can view your Argo applications and launch to the Argo editor.

* View cluster CPU and memory from the cluster node, on the properties dialog. 
+
**Notes:** The cluster CPU and memory percentage that is displayed is the percentage that is currently utilized. This value is rounded down, so a very small value might display as `0`.

+
For Helm subscriptions, see xref:../applications/package_overrides.adoc#configuring-package-overrides[Configuring package overrides] to define the appropriate `packageName` and the `packageAlias` to get an accurate topology display.
+

* View a successful Ansible Tower deployment if you are using Ansible tasks as prehook or posthook for the deployed application. 

+
Click the name of the resource node or select *Actions* > *View application* to see the details about the Ansible task deployment, including Ansible Tower Job URL and template name. Additionally, you can see errors if your Ansible Tower deployment is not successful.

* Click *Launch resource in Search* to search for related resources.

[#search]
== Search

The console _Search_ page supports searching for application resources by the component `kind` for each resource. To search for resources, use the following values:

|===
| Application resource | Kind (search parameter)

| Subscription
| `Subscription`

| Channel
| `Channel`

| Secret
| `Secret`

| Placement rule
| `PlacementRule`

| Application
| `Application`

|===

You can also search by other fields, including name, namespace, cluster, label, and more.

From the search results, you can view identifying details for each resource, including the name, namespace, cluster, labels, and creation date.

If you have access, you can also click *Actions* in the search results and select to delete that resource.

Click the resource name in the search results to open the YAML editor and make changes. Changes that you save are applied to the resource immediately.

For more information about using search, see link:../console/search.adoc#search-in-the-console[Search in the console].

[#advanced-configuration]
== Advanced configuration

Click the *Advanced configuration* tab to view terminology and tables of resources for all applications. You can find resources and you can filter subscriptions, placement rules, and channels. If you have access, you can also click multiple **Actions**, such as Edit, Search, and Delete.

Select a resource to view or edit the YAML.
