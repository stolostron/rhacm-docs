[#placement-rule-samples]
= Placement rule samples overview

Placement rules (`placementrule.apps.open-cluster-management.io`) define the target clusters where deployables can be deployed. Use placement rules to help you facilitate the multicluster deployment of your deployables.

To use the OpenShift CLI tool, see the following procedure:

.. Compose and save your application YAML file with your preferred editing tool.
.. Run the following command to apply your file to an API server. Replace `filename` with the name of your file:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f filename.yaml
----

.. Verify that your application resource is created by running the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc get application.app

[#placement-rule-yaml-structure]
== Placement rule YAML structure

The following YAML structure shows the required fields for a placement rule and some of the common optional fields. Your YAML structure needs to include some required fields and values. Depending on your application management requirements, you might need to include other optional fields and values. You can compose your own YAML content with any tool and in the product console

== Placement rule YAML values table

|===
| Field | Required or Optional| Description

| apiVersion
| Required
| Set the value to `apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| kind
| Required
| Set the value to `PlacementRule` to indicate that the resource is a placement rule.

| metadata.name
| Required
| The name for identifying the placement rule.

| metadata.namespace
| Required
| The namespace resource to use for the placement rule.

| metadata.resourceVersion
| Optional
| The version of the placement rule resource.

| metadata.labels
| Optional
| The labels for the placement rule.

| spec.clusterSelector
| Optional
| The labels for identifying the target clusters

| spec.clusterSelector.matchLabels
| Optional
| The labels that must exist for the target clusters.

| spec.clusterSelector.matchExpressions
| Optional

For application samples that you can deploy, see the https://github.com/stolostron/application-samples[`stolostron`] repository.

Existing placement rules can include the following fields that indicate the status for the placement rule.
This status section is appended after the `spec` section in the YAML structure for a rule.
