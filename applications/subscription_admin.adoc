= Granting subscription administrator privilege 

Learn how to grant subscription administrator access. A _subscription_ administrator can change default behavior. Learn more in the following process:

. From the console, log in to your {ocp} cluster.

. Create one or more users. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/post_installation_configuration/preparing-for-users.html[Preparing for users] for information about creating users. You can also prepare groups or service accounts.

+
Users that you create are administrators for the `app.open-cluster-management.io/subscription` application. With {ocp-short}, a _subscription_ administrator can change default behavior. You can group these users to represent a subscription administrative group, which is demonstrated in later examples.

. From the terminal, log in to your {product-title-short} cluster.

. If `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding does not exist, you need to create it. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
----

. Add the following subjects into `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding with the following command:

+
----
oc edit clusterrolebinding open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
----

+
*Note:* Initially, `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding has no subject.

+
Your subjects might display as the following example:
+

[source,yaml]
----
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: example-name
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: example-group-name
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: my-service-account
  namespace: my-service-account-namespace
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: 'system:serviceaccount:my-service-account-namespace:my-service-account'
----

`Service Account` can be used as a user subject.
