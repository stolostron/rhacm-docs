[#ansible_config]
= Configuring {aap-short}  
 
With {aap-short} jobs, you can automate tasks and integrate with external services, such as Slack and PagerDuty services. Your Git repository resource root path will contain `prehook` and `posthook` directories for {aap-short} jobs that run as part of deploying the application, updating the application, or removing the application from a cluster.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

* <<ansible-secret-reconciliation,Setting secret reconciliation>>
* <<ansible-sample-yaml,Using {aap-short} sample YAML files>>
* <<launch-workflow,Launching Workflow>>

You can configure {aap-short} configurations with the following tasks:

[#ansible-secrets]
== Setting up {aap-short} secrets

You must create an {aap-short} secret custom resources in the same subscription namespace. The {aap-short} secret is limited to the same subscription namespace.

. Create the secret from the console by filling in the `{aap-short} secret name` section. To create the secret using terminal, edit and apply the sample `yaml` file: 

+
*Note:* The `namespace` is the same namespace as the subscription namespace. The `stringData:token` and `host` are from the {aap-short}.

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: toweraccess
  namespace: same-as-subscription
type: Opaque
stringData:
  token: ansible-tower-api-token
  host: https://ansible-tower-host-url
----

. Run the following command to add your YAML file:

+
----
oc apply -f
----

When the app subscription controller creates prehook and posthook Ansible jobs, if the secret from subscription `spec.hooksecretref` is available, then it is sent to the `AnsibleJob` custom resources `spec.tower_auth_secret` and the `AnsibleJob` can access the {aap-short}.

[#ansible-secret-reconciliation]
== Setting secret reconciliation

For a main-sub subscription with prehook and posthook `AnsibleJob`, the main-sub subscription should be reconciled after all prehook and posthook `AnsibleJob` or main subscription are updated in the Git repository. 

Prehook `AnsibleJob` and the main subscription continuously reconcile and relaunch a new pre `AnsibleJob` instance.

. After the pre `AnsibleJob` is complete, re-run the main subscription. 
. If there is any specification change in the main subscription, redeploy the subscription. The main subscription status should be updated to align with the redeployment procedure. 
. Reset the hub cluster subscription status to `nil`. The subscription is refreshed along with the subscription deployment on target clusters. 

+
When the deployment is finished on the target cluster, the subscription status on the target cluster is updated to `"subscribed"` or `"failed"`, and is synced to the hub cluster subscription status.

. After the main subscription is complete, relaunch a new post-`AnsibleJob` instance.

. Verify that the subscription is updated. See the following output:

- subscription.status == `"subscribed"`
- subscription.status == `"propagated"` with all of the target clusters `"subscribed"`

When an `AnsibleJob` custom resources is created, A Kubernetes job custom resources is created to launch an {aap-short} job by communicating to the target {aap-short}. When the job is complete, the final status for the job is returned to `AnsibleJob` `status.AnsibleJob Result`. 

*Notes:* 

The `AnsibleJob` `status.conditions` is reserved by the {aap-short} Job operator for storing the creation of Kubernetes job result. The `status.conditions` does not reflect the actual {aap-short} job status. 

The subscription controller checks the {aap-short} job status by the `AnsibleJob.status.AnsibleJob.Result` instead of `AnsibleJob.status.conditions`.

As previously mentioned in the prehook and posthook `AnsibleJob` workflow, when the main subscription is updated in Git repository, a new prehook and posthook `AnsibleJob` instance is created. As a result, one main subscription can link to multiple `AnsibleJob` instances. 

Four fields are defined in `subscription.status.ansiblejobs`:

- `lastPrehookJobs`: The most recent prehook Ansible jobs
- `prehookJobsHistory`: All the prehook Ansible jobs history
- `lastPosthookJobs`: The most recent posthook Ansible jobs
- `posthookJobsHistory`: All the posthook Ansible jobs history

[#ansible-sample-yaml]
== Using {aap-short} sample YAML files 

See the following sample of an `AnsibleJob` YAML file in a Git prehook and posthook folder:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tower.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AnsibleJob
metadata:
  name: demo-job-001
  namespace: default
spec:
  tower_auth_secret: toweraccess
  job_template_name: Demo Job Template
  extra_vars:
    cost: 6.88
    ghosts: ["inky","pinky","clyde","sue"]
    is_enable: false
    other_variable: foo
    pacman: mrs
    size: 8
    targets_list:
    - aaa
    - bbb
    - ccc
    version: 1.23.45
  job_tags: "provision,install,configuration"
  skip_tags: "configuration,restart"

[#launch-workflow]
== Launching Workflow 

To launch an {aap-short} Workflow by using the `AnsibleJob` custom resource, replace the `job_template_name` field with the `workflow_template_name`, which is displayed in the following example.

[#workflow-sample-yaml]
== Using {aap-short} sample YAML Workflow

See the following sample of a Workflow `AnsibleJob` YAML file in a Git prehook and Git posthook folder:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tower.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AnsibleJob
metadata:
  name: demo-job-001
  namespace: default
spec:
  tower_auth_secret: toweraccess
  workflow_template_name: Demo Workflow Template
  extra_vars:
    cost: 6.88
    ghosts: ["inky","pinky","clyde","sue"]
    is_enable: false
    other_variable: foo
    pacman: mrs
    size: 8
    targets_list:
    - aaa
    - bbb
    - ccc
    version: 1.23.45
