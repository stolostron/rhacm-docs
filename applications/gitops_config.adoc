= Configuring Managed Clusters for OpenShift GitOps operator

To configure GitOps, you can register a set of one or more {product-title} managed clusters to an instance of {ocp} GitOps operator. After registering, you can deploy applications to those clusters. Set up a continuous GitOps environment to automate application consistency across clusters in development, staging, and production environments.

[#prerequisites-argo]
== Prerequisites 

. You need to install the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/cicd/gitops[Red Hat OpenShift GitOps operator] on your {product-title}.

. Import one or more managed clusters.

[#register-gitops]
== Registering managed clusters to GitOps

. Create managed cluster sets and add managed clusters to those managed cluster sets. See the example for managed cluster sets in the https://github.com/open-cluster-management/multicloud-integrations/blob/main/examples/managedclusterset.yaml[multicloud-integrations managedclusterset].

+
See the link:../clusters/managedclustersets.adoc#managedclustersets[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets] documentation for more information.

. Create managed cluster set _binding_ to the namespace where {ocp} GitOps is deployed.

+
See the example in the repository at https://github.com/stolostron/multicloud-integrations/blob/main/examples/managedclustersetbinding.yaml[multicloud-integrations managedclustersetbinding], which binds to the `openshift-gitops` namespace.

+
See the link:../clusters/managedclustersets.adoc#creating-a-managedclustersetbinding[Creating a ManagedClusterSetBinding resource] documentation for more information.

. In the namespace that is used in managed cluster set binding, create a placement custom resource to select a set of managed clusters to register to an {ocp-short} GitOps operator instance. You can use the example in the repository at https://github.com/stolostron/multicloud-integrations/blob/main/examples/placement.yaml[multicloud-integration placement]

+
See link:../clusters/placement_managed.adoc[Using ManagedClustersSets with Placement] for placement information. 

+
*Note:* Only {ocp-short} clusters are registered to an {ocp} GitOps operator instance, not other Kubernetes clusters.

. Create a `GitOpsCluster` custom resource to register the set of managed clusters from the placement decision to the specified instance of {ocp} GitOps. This enables the {ocp} GitOps instance to deploy applications to any of those {product-title-short} managed clusters.

+
Use the example in the repository at https://github.com/stolostron/multicloud-integrations/blob/main/examples/gitopscluster.yaml[multicloud-integrations gitops cluster].

+
*Note:* The referenced `Placement` resource must be in the same namespace as the `GitOpsCluster` resource.

+
See from the following sample that `placementRef.name` is `all-openshift-clusters`, and is specified as target clusters for the GitOps instance that is installed in `argoNamespace: openshift-gitops`. The `argoServer.cluster` specification requires the `local-cluster` value.

*Important security notes:*

When integrating with GitOps operator, for every managed cluster bound to the gitops namespace (through the placement and ManagedClusterSetBinding custom resources ), a secret with a token to access the MangedCluster is created in that namespace. This is required for the Gitops controller to sync resources to the remote managed cluster. When a user is given admin access to a gitops namespace to perform Application LifeCycle operations, the user will also gain access to this secret and thereby admin level to the managed cluster. If this is not acceptable, instead of binding the user to the namespace-scoped admin role, a more restrictive custom role with just the permissions required to work with App lifecycle specific resources can be create and used to bound the user. For example,
