= Managing cluster labels

Add a label to your cluster to select group resources.
See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/[Labels and Selectors] for more information.

You can add new labels, remove existing labels, and edit existing labels for your clusters.
Complete the following steps to manage your labels:

. From the navigation menu, click *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. Find your cluster in the _Clusters_ table.
. Click the *Options* icon to see more.
. Click *Edit labels*.
. From the _Edit labels_ dialog box, enter a label. Your entry might resemble the following content: Key=Value`. 
. Hit enter or space to add additional labels.
. Click *Add*. Labels are saved when the *Add* button is clicked. 
. Click *Done* to close the Edit labels dialog, when you are finished.

* If you want to remove an existing label, click the *Remove* icon, next to the label in the list.
* If you want to undo a *Remove* action, click on the *Deleted* icon, which appears after *Remove* is clicked.
* If you want to update an existing label, you can reassign its key to a new value by adding a new label using the same key with different value.

*Note*: You can also edit a cluster label from a cluster details page. From the navigation menu, click *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 
From the *Clusters* view, access a cluster's details page by clicking the cluster's name, then *Actions* > *Edit labels*.
