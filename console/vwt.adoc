[#visual-web-terminal]
= Visual Web Terminal (Technology preview)

The {product-title} Visual Web Terminal is a Technology preview feature. You can use the Visual Web Terminal to run many commands across your cluster. Run commands and get outputs without leaving the entire console. You can run multiple commands, similar to what you can do in a standard terminal.

With Visual Web Terminal, commands that return cluster resource data are displayed visually in interactive tabular format, rather than plain text that is displayed in a standard terminal. You can see the data, click on a row, and then see more details about that resource. 

By default, Visual Web Terminal includes the versions of the `oc`, `kubectl`, `helm`, and https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/[`subctl`] CLI binaries that are equivalent to the latest {ocp-short} version that is supported by {product-title-short} for the hub cluster.

You can check the versions by running the following commands:

- `oc version`
- `kubectl version`
- `helm version`
- `subctl version`

*Notes:*

The information that is provided in the Visual Web Terminal is limited by the permissions of the user. When you run a command, only the items that you have permission to view are displayed.

If there are over ten sessions that are running at the same time, there might be a slower response time when running commands.

The Visual Web Terminal connects to the cloud that you are already logged into with the hub cluster console.

[#starting-a-session]
== Starting a session

You can access the Visual Web Terminal by completing the following steps:

. Log in to your console.
. Access the terminal either from the console navigation where you can open in a new tab, or select *Visual Web Terminal* icon from the console _Header_. From the header, choose to open in a new tab or open in a current tab.

[#running-commands-vwt]
== Running commands in a session

. Start running commands in the input field. For example, you can start running any `oc` or `kubectl` commands and get an interactive table of resources.
+
*Notes*:
+
** After you run a command in your session and hover your cursor over the command, the following actions are available: _Copy_, _Re-execute this command_, and _End session_
** When you select a resource in the command results table to see the details, the screen is split. The second screen that appears displays the command that was run to display the details. The details that are included in the split-screen details tabs are _Summary_, _YAML_,  and others that are associated with the resource type, for example _Logs_ and _Terminal_. 
. *Optional*: Run the command, `getting started` or select the *getting started* link to pull up the _Getting started_ page in a new tab on the Visual Web Terminal page. The new tab remains open until you close it.
. *Optional*: You can click the buttons to change the default context and namespace using the pop-up finder panel. By default, the context is the hub cluster and the namespace is the default namespace. After you change the default namespace, the `@default` namespace is changed until you manually change it again.
+
*Note*: If you have multiple tabs open, you can select a diifferent namespace for every tab so that the commands that you run on that tab default to the namespace you selected. You can search for the namespace that you want to use.

. Use the <<supported-command-list,Supported command list>> to learn about commands that you can run in addition to `oc`, `kubectl`, `helm`, and `subctl`.

[#supported-command-list]
== Supported command list

The following table provides information and examples for the command types that are supported by the Visual Web Terminal:

|===
| Command | Description | Example

| `!!`
| Run the previous command again.
| `!!`

| `bash` commands
| Run the following basic `bash` commands: `base64`, `basename`, `cat`, `cksum`, `cp`, `cut`, `date`, `dirname`, `echo`, `grep`, `head`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `printf`, `readlink`, `rm`, `tail`, `touch`, `uname`, `vi`, and `vim`
| `mkdir new_directory`

| `cd`
| Change the current working directory within your Visual Web Terminal session. When the session starts, you are given a home directory. You can create files and directories from the home directory, but you are not allowed to access any other directories. The contents of your home directory only exist during the current Visual Web Terminal session. It does not persist after you close the page.
| `cd dir_name`

| `clear`
| Clear the screen of previous commands and output.
| `clear`

| `export`
| Export the output of the command to an external file.
| `export search search_criteria`

| `helm`
| Run supported `helm` commands.
*Tip:* See the https://v2.helm.sh/docs/helm/#helm[helm commands] topic in the Helm documentation for more information about the Helm commands.
| `helm list --chart-name`

| `help` (alias for `getting started`)
| Display additional information about a command that is supported in the Visual Web Terminal on the _Getting Started_ page.
| `help`

| `history`
| Displays the previous 20 commands that were run during the current session.
*Tip:* You can limit the search criteria by adding it to the end of the command.
For example, `history help` displays the last 25 commands that contained the string _help_.
| `history`

| `kubectl` or `k`
| Run supported `kubectl` (or shorthand `k`) commands.
*Tip:* See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands[Kubernetes CLI reference] for more information about the `kubectl` commands.
| `kubectl get pods`

| `oc`
| Runs Red Hat OpenShift `oc` commands.
*Tip:* See https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html[Red Hat OpenShift CLI Operations] for more information about the `oc` commands. For example, when you run `oc get pods` the pods in your cluster are shown as a table view or grid view. The grid is used if there are 25 or more rows displayed. In the case of the grid when you hover over a square, the name of the pod and status are shown. For either the grid or table view, select the grid square or table row to get details about that resource. If you want to change the view from grid to table, select the *Table* icon at the end of the grid.
| `oc get svc`

| `search`
| Searches your Kubernetes resources for those that match the specified search filters and parameters.
| `search pod`

| `savedsearches`
| Displays your saved searches that you created and saved in the _Search_ page.
| `savedsearches` *Tip:* You can specify a string after the `savedsearches` command to limit the data that is returned.
For example, `savedsearches projectA` displays the saved searches that contain the string _projectA_.

| `sleep`
| Pauses activity during a session.
*Note:* Requires a `sleepTime` parameter that identifies the number of seconds that it pauses.
| `sleep 20`

| `themes`
| Displays a drop-down list of the contrast theme options of the interface, which you can set to either `PatternFly4 Light` or `PatternFly4 Dark`. 
| `themes`

[#searching-with-visual-web-terminal]
== Searching with Visual Web Terminal

The Visual Web Terminal search function provides visibility into your resources across all your clusters.

You can only search for resources based on your role-based access control level assignment.
If you save and share a search query with another user, returned results for that user depend on his or her access level.

. Start a Visual Web Terminal session.
. In the command entry field of the Visual Web Terminal, type: `search`.
When you run a `search` command, the Visual Web Terminal verifies that the search function is available.
If it is not available, a message indicates that either the search function is not installed, or that it is just not available.
If it is installed, but not available, it might be a network issue.
. Add a space after the `search` command.
The list of filters that are available for the search is displayed.
The list of filters might be empty because it is dependent on the resources that are available in your environment and your role permissions.
. Select one of the filters from the list.
The selected filter is added to the search criteria on your command line, and the next level of filters for that selection are displayed.
*Tip:* You can also enter a string after the `search` command, rather than selecting a filter from the list.
. Optional: Add filters by entering a single space after each filter entry until your command contains all of the required filters.
. When you are finished adding your search criteria, press *Enter* to run the search.

You can refine your results with specific fields.
See the following example:

* Search for a single field, such as `kind:pod` to find all pod resources.
* Search for multiple fields, such as `kind:pod namespace:default` to find the pods in the default namespace.

You can also search with conditions using characters, such as (>, >=, <, \<=, !=).

See the following examples:

* Search for `kind:pod status:!Running` to find all pod resources where the status is not `Running`.
* Search for `kind:pod restarts:>1` to find all pods that have restarted at least twice.

The search returns resources that meet the criteria of your search request, as well as links to view related resources.
Viewing all of them helps you visualize how the resources interact with other resources in the system.

Your search results are grouped by `kind` and each resource `kind` is grouped in a table.
You can reorder the data in the tables by selecting the row and column headings.

You can use a search that was saved in the console by entering the `savedsearches` command and selecting the search that you want to run.
