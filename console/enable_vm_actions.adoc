[#enable-vm-actions]
= Enabling virtual machine actions (Technology Preview)

To view `VirtualMachine` resources across all the clusters that {acm} manages, use the Search feature to list and filter the `VirtualMachine` resources created with the {ocp-virt}. You can also enable the following actions from the {acm-short} console on your `VirtualMachine` resources:

- Start
- Stop
- Restart
- Pause
- Unpause

[#vm-actions-prereq]
== Prerequisites

- *Required access:* Cluster administrator
- Confirm that the _ManagedServiceAccount_ add-on is enabled. See link:../../clusters/install_upgrade/adv_config_install.adoc#serviceaccount-addon-intro[ManagedServiceAccount add-on].

[#enable-actions-acm]
== Enabling virtual machine actions for {acm-short}

You can enable the virtual machine actions for {acm-short} by updating the console config map. Complete the following steps:

. To update the {acm-short} console config map for enabling virtual machine actions, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc patch configmap console-mce-config -n multicluster-engine -p '{"data": {"VIRTUAL_MACHINE_ACTIONS": "enabled"}}'
----

. To configure {acm-short} to process the actions, create and configure a `ManagedServiceAccount` resource for each managed cluster. Save the following YAML file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: authentication.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: ManagedServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: vm-actor
  labels:
    app: search
spec:
  rotation: {}
---
apiVersion: rbac.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterPermission
metadata:
  name: vm-actions
  labels:
    app: search
spec:
  clusterRole:
    rules:
      - apiGroups:
          - subresources.kubevirt.io
        resources:
          - virtualmachines/start
          - virtualmachines/stop
          - virtualmachines/restart
          - virtualmachineinstances/pause
          - virtualmachineinstances/unpause
        verbs:
          - update
  clusterRoleBinding:
    subject:
      kind: ServiceAccount
      name: vm-actor
      namespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----
+
*Note:* You must repeat this step for each new managed cluster.

. Apply the `ManagedServiceAccount` resource to your hub cluster by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n <MANAGED_CLUSTER> -f /path/to/file
----

The virtual machine actions are enabled for {acm-short}.

[#disable-vm-actions]
== Disabling virtual machine actions

To disable virtual machine actions for {acm-short}, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
oc patch configmap console-mce-config -n multicluster-engine -p '{"data": {"VIRTUAL_MACHINE_ACTIONS": "disabled"}}'
----

The virtual machine actions are disabled for {acm-short}.

[#delete-vm-actions]
== Deleting ManagedServiceAccounts and ClusterPermissions resources

To delete `ManagedServiceAccounts` and `ClusterPermissions` resources that use virtual machine actions, complete the following steps:

. To delete the resources, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc delete managedserviceaccount,clusterpermission -A -l app=search
----
+
You might receive the following output:

+
[source,bash]
----
managedserviceaccount.authentication.open-cluster-management.io "vm-actor" deleted managedserviceaccount.authentication.open-cluster-management.io "vm-actor" deleted clusterpermission.rbac.open-cluster-management.io "vm-actions" deleted clusterpermission.rbac.open-cluster-management.io "vm-actions" deleted
----

. To confirm that the clean up is complete, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get managedserviceaccount,clusterpermission -A -l app=search
----

+
When the resources are deleted successfully, you receive the following message:

+
[source,bash]
----
"No resources found"
----

The `ManagedServiceAccounts` and `ClusterPermissions` resources are deleted.
