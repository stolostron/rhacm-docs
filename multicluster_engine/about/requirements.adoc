[#requirements-and-recommendations]
= Requirements and recommendations

Before you install the {mce}, review the following system configuration requirements and settings:

* <<supported-operating-systems-and-platforms,Supported operating systems and platforms>>
* <<network-configuration,Network configuration>>

*Important:* You must install multicluster engine for Kubernetes on a cluster that does not have Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes earlier than 2.5 installed. The multicluster engine for Kubernetes cannot co-exist with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes on versions earlier than 2.5 because they provide some of the same management components. It is recommended that you install multicluster engine for Kubernetes on a cluster that has never previously installed Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. If you are using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes at version 2.5 or later then multicluster engine for Kubernetes is already installed on the cluster with it.


[#supported-operating-systems-and-platforms]
== Supported operating systems and platforms for multicluster engine for Kubernetes clusters and managed clusters

See the following table for supported operating systems:

|===
| Platform | Supported for multicluster engine for Kubernetes cluster| Supported for managed cluster
|{ocp} 3.11.200, and later 3.11.x releases| No | Yes
|{ocp} 4.8.2, and later| Yes | Yes
|{ocp} on Amazon Web Services| Yes | Yes
|{ocp} on Microsoft Azure| Yes | Yes
|{ocp} on Google Cloud Platform| Yes | Yes
| Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Engine| No | Yes
| Google Kubernetes Engine (Google GKE) (Kubernetes 1.17, and later)| No | Yes
| Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) (Kubernetes 1.17.6, and later)| No | Yes
| Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (Microsoft AKS) (Kubernetes 1.19.6, and later)| No | Yes
|===

[#network-configuration]
== Network configuration

Configure your network settings to allow the connections in the following sections:

**Important:** The trusted CA bundle is available in the {mce} namespace, but that enhancement requires changes to your network. The trusted CA bundle ConfigMap uses the default name of `trusted-ca-bundle`. You can change this name by providing it to the operator in an environment variable named `TRUSTED_CA_BUNDLE`. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy#nw-proxy-configure-object_config-cluster-wide-proxy[Configuring the cluster-wide proxy] in the _Networking_ section of {ocp} for more information.


[#network-configuration-engine]
=== The {mce} networking requirements

For the {mce} cluster networking requirements, see the following table:

|===
| Direction | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound
| Kubernetes API server of the provisioned managed cluster
| 6443

| Outbound and inbound
| The `WorkManager` service route on the managed cluster
| 443

| Inbound
| The Kubernetes API server of the multicluster engine for Kubernetes cluster from the managed cluster
| 6443

| Inbound
| Post-commit hook from GitHub to the multicluster engine for Kubernetes cluster. This setting is only required when you use certain application management functions.
