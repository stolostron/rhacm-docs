= Console overview

{ocp-short} console plug-ins are available with {ocp-short} 4.10 web console and can be integrated. To use this feature, the console plug-ins must remain enabled. The multicluster engine operator displays certain console features from *Infrastructure* and *Credentials* navigation items. If you install {product-title-short}, you see more console capability.

*Note:* For {ocp-short} 4.10 with the plug-ins enabled, you can access {product-title-short} within the {ocp-short} console from the cluster switcher by selecting *All Clusters* from the drop-down menu. 

. To disable the plug-in, be sure you are in the _Administrator_ perspective in the {ocp-short} console.
. Find *Administration* in the navigation and click *Cluster Settings*, then click _Configuration_ tab. 
. From the list of _Configuration resources_, click the **Console** resource with the `operator.openshift.io` API group, which contains cluster-wide configuration for the web console. 
. Click on the _Console plug-ins_ tab. The `mce` plug-in is listed. *Note:* If {product-title-short} is installed, it is also listed as `acm`.
. Modify plug-in status from the table. In a few moments, you are prompted to refresh the console.
