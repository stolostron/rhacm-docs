[#console-hosted-pending-import]
=== Console displays hosted cluster as Pending import 
//2.7:25594

If the annotation and `ManagedCluster` name do not match, the console displays the cluster as `Pending import`. The cluster cannot be used by the {mce}. The same issue happens when there is no annotation and the `ManagedCluster` name does not match the `HostedCluster` `Infra-ID` value.
