[#creating-a-credential-for-vmware-vsphere]
= Creating a credential for VMware vSphere

You need a credential to use {product-title} console to deploy and manage a {ocp} cluster on VMware vSphere. *Note:* Only {ocp-short} versions 4.5.x, and later, are supported.

**Required access**: Edit

*Note:* This procedure must be done before you can create a cluster with {product-title-short}.

[#vsphere_cred_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before you create a credential:

* A deployed {product-title-short} hub cluster on {ocp-short} version 4.6 or later.
* Internet access for your {product-title-short} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on VMware vSphere.
* VMware vSphere login credentials and vCenter requirements configured for {ocp-short} when using installer-provisioned infrastructure.
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html/installing/installing-on-vsphere#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations[Installing a cluster on vSphere with customizations]. These credentials include the following information:
** vCenter account privileges.
** Cluster resources.
** DHCP available.
** ESXi hosts have time synchronized (for example, NTP).

== Managing a credential by using the console

To create a credential from the {product-title} console, complete the steps in the console. 

Start at the navigation menu. Click *Credentials* to choose from existing credential options. *Tip:* Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, both for convenience and added security.

You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your credential. If you add the base DNS domain to the credential, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this credential. See the following steps:

. Add your _VMware vCenter server fully-qualified host name or IP address_. The value must be defined in the vCenter server root CA certificate. If possible, use the fully-qualified host name.
. Add your _VMware vCenter username_.
. Add your _VMware vCenter password_.
. Add your _VMware vCenter root CA certificate_.
.. You can download your certificate in the `download.zip` package with the certificate from your VMware vCenter server at: `https://<vCenter_address>/certs/download.zip`. Replace _vCenter_address_ with the address to your vCenter server. 
.. Unpackage the `download.zip`.
.. Use the certificate from the `certs/<platform>` directory that has a `.0` extension. *Tip:* You can use the `ls certs/<platform>` command to list all of the available certificates for your platform.
+
Replace `_<platform>_` with the abbreviation for your platform: `lin`, `mac`, or `win`. 
+
For example: `certs/lin/3a343545.0`
. Add your _VMware vSphere cluster name_.
. Add your _VMware vSphere datacenter_.
. Add your _VMware vSphere default datastore_.

. [[disconnected-vm]]For disconnected installations only: Complete the fields in the *Configuration for disconnected installation* subsection with the required information:
+
* _Image content source_: This value contains the disconnected registry path. The path contains the hostname, port, and repository path to all of the installation images for disconnected installations. Example: `repository.com:5000/openshift/ocp-release`.
+
The path creates an image content source policy mapping in the `install-config.yaml` to the {ocp} release images. As an example, `repository.com:5000` produces this `imageContentSource` content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
imageContentSources:
- mirrors:
  - registry.example.com:5000/ocp4
  source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release-nightly
- mirrors:
  - registry.example.com:5000/ocp4
  source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
- mirrors:
  - registry.example.com:5000/ocp4
  source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
----
* _Additional trust bundle_: This value provides the contents of the certificate file that is required to access the mirror registry.
+
*Note:* If you are deploying managed clusters from a hub that is in a disconnected environment, and want them to be automatically imported post install, add an Image Content Source Policy to the `install-config.yaml` file by using the `YAML` editor. A sample entry is shown in the following example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
imageContentSources:
- mirrors:
  - registry.example.com:5000/rhacm2
  source: registry.redhat.io/rhacm2
----

. [[proxy-vm]]If you want to enable a proxy, enter the proxy information: 
+
* HTTP proxy URL: The URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

* HTTPS proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`. 

* No proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add and asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

* Additional trust bundle: The contents of the certificate file that is required to access the mirror registry.

. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift pull secret_. You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].

. Add your _SSH private key_ and _SSH public key_, which allows you to connect to the cluster.
+
You can use an existing key pair, or create a new one with key generation program.
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html/installing/installing-on-vsphere#ssh-agent-using_installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned[Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access] for more information.

You can create a cluster that uses this credential by completing the steps in link:../multicluster_engine/create_vm.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-vmware-vsphere[Creating a cluster on VMware vSphere].

You can edit your credential in the console. 

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential. Select *Actions* to delete in bulk, or select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.
