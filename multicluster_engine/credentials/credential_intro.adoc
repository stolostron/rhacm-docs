= Managing credentials

You can create and manage your cluster credentials. A _credential_ is required to create a {ocp} cluster on a cloud service provider with {mce}. The credential stores the access information for a cloud provider. Each provider account requires its own credential, as does each domain on a single provider.

Credentials are stored as Kubernetes secrets. Secrets are copied to the namespace of a managed cluster so that the controllers for the managed cluster can access the secrets. When a credential is updated, the copies of the secret are automatically updated in the managed cluster namespaces.

*Note:* Changes to the pull secret or SSH keys of cloud provider credentials are not reflected for existing managed clusters, as they have already been provisioned using the original credentials.
