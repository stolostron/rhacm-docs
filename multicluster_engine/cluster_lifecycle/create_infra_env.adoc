[#creating-an-infrastructure-environment]
= Creating an infrastructure environment

You can use the console to create an infrastructure environment to manage your hosts and create clusters on those hosts.

* <<infra-env-prerequisites,Prerequisites>>
* <<enable-cim,Enable Central Infrastructure Management service>>
** <<manually-create-cr,Manually create the Provisioning custom resource (CR)>>
** <<enable-cim-aws,Enable Central Infrastructure Management on Amazon Web Services>>
* <<creating-your-infra-env-with-the-console,Creating your infrastructure environment with the console>>

Infrastructure environments support the following features:

- Zero-touch provisioning of clusters: Deploy clusters using a script. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/scalability_and_performance/index#installing-disconnected-rhacm_ztp-preparing-the-hub-cluster[Installing GitOps ZTP in a disconnected environment] in the {ocp} documentation for more information.
- Late binding: Add a node to an existing cluster. An infrastructure administrator can boot the host, and the cluster creator can bind the host to the existing cluster at a later time. Administrator privileges are not required for the cluster creator to access the infrastructure when using late binding.
- Dual stack: Deploy clusters that have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Dual stack uses the `OVN-Kubernetes` networking implementation to support multiple subnets. 
- Add remote worker nodes: Add remote worker nodes to your clusters after they are created and running, which provides flexibility of adding nodes in other locations for backup purposes.
- Static IP using NMState: Use the NMState API to define static IP addresses for your environment.

[#infra-env-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

See the following prerequisites before creating an infrastructure environment:

* You must have {ocp-short} deployed on your hub cluster.
* You need Internet access for your hub cluster (connected), or a connection to an internal or mirror registry that has a connection to the Internet (disconnected) to retrieve the required images for creating the environment.
* You need a configured instance of the Central Infrastructure Management (CIM) feature on your hub cluster. 
* You need an {ocp-short} https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[pull secret]. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets] for more information. 
* You need your SSH key that is in your `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file, by default.
* You need a configured storage class. 
* *Disconnected environment only:* Complete the procedure for https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/scalability_and_performance/clusters-at-the-network-far-edge#ztp-acm-preparing-to-install-disconnected-acm_ztp-deploying-disconnected[Clusters at the network far edge] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

[#enable-cim]
== Enabling the Central Infrastructure Management service

The Central Infrastructure Management service is provided with the {mce-short} and deploys {ocp-short} clusters. CIM is deployed when you enable the `MultiClusterHub` Operator on the hub cluster, but must be enabled.

To enable the CIM service, complete the following steps: 

*Important:* Only if your hub cluster is installed on one of the following platforms: bare metal, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, VMware vSphere, or was installed by using the user-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) method and the platform is `None`, complete the following step. Skip this step if your hub cluster is on any other platform. 

. Modify the `Provisioning` resource to allow the Bare Metal Operator to watch all namespaces by running the following command:

+
----
oc patch provisioning provisioning-configuration --type merge -p '{"spec":{"watchAllNamespaces": true }}'
----

. *For disconnected environments:* Create a `ConfigMap` in the _same namespace_ as your infrastructure operator to specify the values for `ca-bundle.crt` and `registries.conf` for your mirror registry. Your file `ConfigMap` should resemble the following example: 

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <mirror-config>
  namespace: "<infrastructure-operator-namespace>"
  labels:
    app: assisted-service
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    certificate contents
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

  registries.conf: |
    unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]

    [[registry]]
       prefix = ""
       location = "registry.redhat.io/multicluster-engine"
       mirror-by-digest-only = true

       [[registry.mirror]]
       location = "mirror.registry.com:5000/multicluster-engine"
----

[#create-cr-cim]
=== Creating the _AgentServiceConfig_ custom resource

Create the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource by completing the following steps:

. *For disconnected environments only:* Save the following `YAML` content in the `agent_service_config.yaml` file and replace the values as needed:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
 name: agent
spec:
  databaseStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <db_volume_size> 
  filesystemStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <fs_volume_size>
  mirrorRegistryRef:
    name: <mirror_config>
  unauthenticatedRegistries:
    - <unauthenticated_registry>
  imageStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <img_volume_size>
  osImages: 
    - openshiftVersion: "<ocp_version>" 
      version: "<ocp_release_version>" 
      url: "<iso_url>"
      cpuArchitecture: "x86_64"
----
+
Replace `mirror_config` with the name of the `ConfigMap` that contains your mirror registry configuration details. 
+
Include the optional `unauthenticated_registry` parameter if you are using a mirror registry that does not require authentication. Entries on this list are not validated or required to have an entry in the pull secret.

. *For connected environments only:* Save the following `YAML` content in the `agent_service_config.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
 name: agent
spec:
  databaseStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <db_volume_size> 
  filesystemStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <fs_volume_size>
  imageStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <img_volume_size>
----
+
Replace `db_volume_size` with the volume size for the `databaseStorage` field, for example `10Gi`. This value specifies how much storage is allocated for storing files such as database tables and database views for the clusters. You might need to use a higher value if there are many clusters.
+
Replace `fs_volume_size` with the size of the volume for the `filesystemStorage` field, for example `200M` per cluster and `2-3Gi` per supported {ocp-short} version. The minimum value that is required is `100Gi`. This value specifies how much storage is allocated for storing logs, manifests, and `kubeconfig` files for the clusters. You might need to use a higher value if there are many clusters. 
+
Replace `img_volume_size` with the size of the volume for the `imageStorage` field, for example `2Gi` per operating system image. The minimum size is `50Gi`. This value specifies how much storage is allocated for the images of the clusters. You need to allow 1 GB of image storage for each instance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS that is running. You might need to use a higher value if there are many clusters and instances of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS.
+
Replace `ocp_version` with the {ocp-short} version to install.
+
Replace `ocp_release_version` with the specific install version, for example, `49.83.202103251640-0`.
+
Replace `iso_url` with the ISO url, for example, `https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/dependencies/rhcos/4.10/4.10.3/rhcos-4.10.3-x86_64-live.x86_64.iso`. You can find other values at: https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/dependencies/rhcos/4.10/4.10.3/.

. Create the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource by running the following command:

+
----
oc create -f agent_service_config.yaml
----
+
The output might resemble the following example:
+
----
agentserviceconfig.agent-install.openshift.io/agent created
----

Your CIM service is configured. You can verify that it is healthy by checking the `assisted-service` and `assisted-image-service` deployments and ensuring that their pods are ready and running. 

[#manually-create-cr]
=== Manually create the Provisioning custom resource (CR)

Manually create a `Provisioning` CR to enable services for automated provisioning by using the following command:

----
oc create -f provisioning-configuration.yaml
----

Your CR might resemble the following sample:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: Provisioning
metadata:
  name: provisioning-configuration
spec:
  provisioningNetwork: Disabled
  watchAllNamespaces: true
----

[#enable-cim-aws]
=== Enabling Central Infrastructure Management on Amazon Web Services

If you are running your hub cluster on Amazon Web Services and want to enable the CIM service, complete the following additional steps after <<enable-cim,Enabling CIM>>:

. Make sure you are logged in at the hub and find the unique domain configured on the `assisted-image-service` by running the following command:
+
----
oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep assisted-image-service
----
+
Your domain might resemble the following example:
`assisted-image-service-multicluster-engine.apps.<yourdomain>.com`

. Make sure you are logged in at the hub and create a new `IngressController` with a unique domain using the `NLB` `type` parameter. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: ingress-controller-with-nlb
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  domain: nlb-apps.<domain>.com
  routeSelector:
      matchLabels:
        router-type: nlb
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: LoadBalancerService
    loadBalancer:
      scope: External
      providerParameters:
        type: AWS
        aws:
          type: NLB
----

. Add `<yourdomain>` to the `domain` parameter in `IngressController` by replacing `<domain>` in `nlb-apps.<domain>.com` with `<yourdomain>`.

. Apply the new `IngressController` by using the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f ingresscontroller.yaml
----

. Make sure that the value of the `spec.domain` parameter of the new `IngressController` is not in conflict with an existing IngressController by completing the following steps:

.. List all `IngressControllers` by running the following command:
+
----
oc get ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator
----

.. Run the following command on each of the `IngressControllers`, except the `ingress-controller-with-nlb` that you just created:
+
----
oc edit ingresscontroller <name> -n openshift-ingress-operator
----
+
If the `spec.domain` report is missing, add a default domain that matches all of the routes that are exposed in the cluster except `nlb-apps.<domain>.com`.
+
If the `spec.domain` report is provided, make sure that the `nlb-apps.<domain>.com` route is excluded from the specified range.

. Run the following command to edit the `assisted-image-service` route to use the `nlb-apps` location:
+
----
oc edit route assisted-image-service -n <namespace>
----
+
*Tip:* The default namespace is where you installed the {mce}.

. Add the following lines to the `assisted-image-service` route:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  labels:
    router-type: nlb
  name: assisted-image-service
----

. In the `assisted-image-service` route, find the URL value of `spec.host`. The URL might resemble the following example:
+
`assisted-image-service-multicluster-engine.apps.<yourdomain>.com`

. Replace `apps` in the URL with `nlb-apps` to match the domain configured in the new `IngressController`.

To verify that the CIM service is enabled on Amazon Web Services, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command to verify that the pods are healthy:
+
----
oc get pods -n multicluster-engine | grep assist
----

. Create a new infrastructure environment and ensure that the download URL uses the new `nlb-apps` URL.

[#creating-your-infra-env-with-the-console]
== Creating your infrastructure environment with the console

To create an infrastructure environment from the console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Host inventory* and click *Create infrastructure environment*.
. Add the following information to your infrastructure environment settings: 
+
* Name: A unique name for your infrastructure environment. 
* Network type: Specifies which types of hosts can be added to your infrastructure environment. You can only use the static IP option when you are using bare metal hosts. 
* Location: Specifies the geographic location of the host. The geographic location can be used to easily determine where your data on a cluster is stored when you are creating the cluster. 
* Labels: Optional field where you can add labels to the infrastructure environment so you can more easily find and group the environment with other environments that share a characteristic. The selections that you made for the network type and location are automatically added to the list of labels.
* Pull secret: Your {ocp-short} https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[pull secret] that enables you to access the {ocp-short} resources. 
* SSH public key: The SSH key that enables the secure communication with the hosts. This is generally in your `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file, by default.
* If you want to enable proxy settings across all of your clusters, select the setting to enable it. This requires that you enter the following information: 
+
** HTTP Proxy URL: The URL that should be used when accessing the discovery service. 

** HTTPS Proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used when accessing the discovery service. Note that the format must be `http`, as `https` is not yet supported. 

** No Proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add and asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

You can now continue by adding hosts to your infrastructure environment. 

To access an infrastructure environment, select *Infrastructure* > *Host inventory* in the console. Select your infrastructure environment from the list to view the details and hosts for that infrastructure environment.
