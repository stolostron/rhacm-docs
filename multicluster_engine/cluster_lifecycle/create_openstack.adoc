[#creating-a-cluster-on-openstack]
= Creating a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform

You can use the {mce} console to deploy a {ocp} cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

When you create a cluster, the creation process uses the {ocp-short} installer with the Hive resource. If you have questions about cluster creation after completing this procedure, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/installing/installing-on-openstack[Installing on OpenStack] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information about the process.

[#openstack-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

See the following prerequisites before creating a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform:

* You must have a {product-title-short} hub cluster that is deployed on {ocp-short} version 4.6, or later.
* You need Internet access for your {product-title-short} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.
* You must have a Red Hat OpenStack Platform credential. See xref:../credentials/credential_openstack.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-openstack[Creating a credential for Red Hat OpenStack Platform] for more information.
* You need an {ocp-short} image pull secret. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets].
* You need the following information for the Red Hat OpenStack Platform instance where you are deploying:
** Flavor name for the control plane and worker instances; for example, `m1.xlarge`
** Network name for the external network to provide the floating IP addresses
** Required floating IP addresses for API and ingress instances
** DNS records for:
*** `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which must point to the floating IP address for the API
*** `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which must point to the floating IP address for ingress

[#openstack-creating-your-cluster-with-the-console]
== Creating your cluster with the console

To create a cluster from the {mce} console, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. On the _Clusters_ page, click *Create cluster* and complete the steps in the console. 

*Note:* This procedure is for creating a cluster. If you have an existing cluster that you want to import, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster] for those steps.

If you need to create a credential, see xref:../credentials/credential_openstack.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-openstack[Creating a credential for Red Hat OpenStack Platform] for more information.

The name of the cluster is used in the hostname of the cluster. The name must contain fewer than 15 characters. This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the credential prerequisites section.

*Important:* When you create a cluster, the {product-title-short} controller creates a namespace for the cluster and its resources. Ensure that you include only resources for that cluster instance in that namespace. Destroying the cluster deletes the namespace and all of the resources in it.

*Tip:* Select *YAML: On* to view content updates as you enter the information in the console.

[#openstack_adding-your-cluster-to-existing-cluster-set]
== Adding your cluster to an existing cluster set

If you want to add your cluster to an existing cluster set, you must have the correct permissions on the cluster set to add it. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges when you are creating the cluster, you must select a cluster set on which you have `clusterset-admin` permissions. If you do not have the correct permissions on the specified cluster set, the cluster creation fails. Contact your cluster administrator to provide you with `clusterset-admin` permissions to a cluster set if you do not have any cluster set options to select.

Every managed cluster must be associated with a managed cluster set. If you do not assign the managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

If there is already a base DNS domain that is associated with the selected credential that you configured for your Red Hat OpenStack Platform account, that value is populated in the field. You can change the value by overwriting it. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.1/html/users_and_identity_management_guide/domains[Managing domains] in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform documentation for more information. This name is used in the hostname of the cluster.
 
The release image identifies the version of the {ocp-short} image that is used to create the cluster. If the version that you want to use is available, you can select the image from the list of images. If the image that you want to use is not a standard image, you can enter the URL to the image that you want to use. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/release_images.adoc#release-images[Release images] for more information about release images. Only release images for {ocp-short} versions 4.6.x and higher are supported.

The node pools include the control plane pool and the worker pools. The control plane nodes share the management of the cluster activity. The information includes the following fields:

* *Optional* Architecture: If the architecture type of the managed cluster is not the same as the architecture of your hub cluster, enter a value for the instruction set architecture of the machines in the pool. Valid values are _amd64_, _ppc64le_, _s390x_, and _arm64_.

* Instance type for your control plane pool: You can change the type and size of your instance after it is created.

You can create one or more worker nodes in a worker pool to run the container workloads for the cluster. They can be in a single worker pool, or distributed across multiple worker pools. If zero worker nodes are specified, the control plane nodes also function as worker nodes. The information includes the following fields:

* Instance type: You can change the type and size of your instance after it is created.

* Node count: Specify the node count for your worker pool. This setting is required when you define a worker pool.

Networking details are required for your cluster. You must provide the values for one or more networks for an IPv4 network. For an IPv6 network, you must define more than one network.

You can add an additional network by clicking *Add network*. You must have more than one network if you are using IPv6 addresses.

Proxy information that is provided in the credential is automatically added to the proxy fields. You can use the information as it is, overwrite it, or add the information if you want to enable a proxy. The following list contains the required information for creating a proxy:  

* HTTP proxy URL: Specify the URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

* HTTPS proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.

* No proxy domains: Define a comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add an asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

* Additional trust bundle: Specify the contents of the certificate file that is required to access the mirror registry. 

You can define the disconnected installation image by clicking *Disconnected installation*. See link:../../release_notes/known_issues.adoc#create-with-disconnected[Disconnected installation settings for cluster creation cannot be entered or are ignored if entered] for more details on limitations.

When you review your information and optionally customize it before creating the cluster, you can click the *YAML* switch *On* to view the `install-config.yaml` file content in the panel. You can edit the YAML file with your custom settings, if you have any updates.  

*Note:* You do not have to run the `kubectl` command that is provided with the cluster details to import the cluster. When you create the cluster, it is automatically configured under the management of {product-title-short}.

Continue with xref:../cluster_lifecycle/access_cluster.adoc#accessing-your-cluster[Accessing your cluster] for instructions for accessing your cluster.
