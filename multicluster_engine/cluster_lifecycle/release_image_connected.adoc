= Maintaining a custom list of release images when connected

You might want to ensure that you use the same release image for all of your clusters.
To simplify, you can create your own custom list of release images that are available when creating a cluster.
Complete the following steps to manage your available release images:

. If the installer-managed `acm-hive-openshift-releases` subscription is enabled, disable it by setting the value of `disableUpdateClusterImageSets` to `true` in the `multiclusterhub` resource.
. Fork the https://github.com/stolostron/acm-hive-openshift-releases/tree/release-2.5[acm-hive-openshift-releases GitHub repository 2.5 branch].
. Update the `./subscribe/channel.yaml` file by changing the `spec: pathname` to access your the GitHub name for your forked repository, instead of `stolostron`.
This step specifies where the hub cluster retrieves the release images.
Your updated content should look similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  type: Git
  pathname: https://github.com/<forked_content>/acm-hive-openshift-releases.git
----
+
Replace `forked_content` with the path to your forked repository.

. Add the YAML files for the images that you want available when you create a cluster by using the {mce} console to the _./clusterImageSets/stable/*_ or _./clusterImageSets/fast/*_ directory.
+
*Tip:* You can retrieve the available YAML files from the main repository by merging changes into your forked repository.
. Commit and merge your changes to your forked repository.
. To synchronize your list of fast release images after you have cloned the `acm-hive-openshift-releases` repository, enter the following command to update the fast images:
+
----
make subscribe-fast
----
+
*Note:* You can only run this `make` command when you are using the Linux or MacOS operating system. 
+
After running this command, the list of available fast release images updates with the currently available images in about one minute.

. By default, only the fast images are listed.
To synchronize and display the stable release images, enter the following command:
+
----
make subscribe-stable
----
+
*Note:* You can only run this `make` command when you are using the Linux or MacOS operating system. 
+
After running this command, the list of available stable release images updates with the currently available images in about 1 minute.

. By default, {product-title-short} pre-loads a few ClusterImageSets.
You can use the following commands to list what is available and remove the defaults.
+
----
oc get clusterImageSets
oc delete clusterImageSet <clusterImageSet_NAME>
----
+
*Note:* If you have not disabled the installer-managed automatic updates of the `ClusterImageSets` by setting the value of `disableUpdateClusterImageSets` to `true` in the `multiclusterhub` resource, any images that you delete are recreated automatically.

. View the list of currently available release images in the {product-title-short} console when you are creating a cluster.
