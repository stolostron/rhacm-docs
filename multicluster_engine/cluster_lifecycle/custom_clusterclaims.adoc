= Create custom ClusterClaims

You can create ClusterClaims with custom names on a managed cluster, which makes it easier to identify them. The custom ClusterClaims are synchronized with the status of the `ManagedCluster` resource on the hub cluster. The following content shows an example of a definition for a customized `ClusterClaim`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterClaim
metadata:
  name: <custom_claim_name>
spec:
  value: <custom_claim_value>
----

The max length of field `spec.value` is 1024. The `create` permission on resource `clusterclaims.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` is required to create a ClusterClaim.
