= Removing a managed cluster from a ManagedClusterSet

You might want to remove a managed cluster from a managed cluster set to move it to a different managed cluster set, or remove it from the management settings of the set. You can remove a managed cluster from a managed cluster set by using the console or the command-line interface. 

**Note:** Every managed cluster must be assigned to a managed cluster set. If you remove a managed cluster from a `ManagedClusterSet` and do not assign it to a different `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

== Removing a managed cluster from a ManagedClusterSet by using the console

Complete the following steps to remove a cluster from a managed cluster set by using the {product-title-short} console:

. If you just created your managed cluster set, select *Manage resource assignments* to go directly to the _Manage resource assignments_ page. Continue with step 5 of this procedure. 

. If your cluster already exists, access the cluster page by selecting *Infrastructure* > *Clusters* in the main navigation and ensure that the _Cluster sets_ tab is selected. 

. Select the name of the cluster set that you want to remove from the managed cluster set to view the cluster set details.

. Select *Actions* > *Manage resource assignments*.

. On the _Manage resource assignments_ page, select the checkbox for the resources that you want to remove from the cluster set. 
+
This step removes a resource that is already a member of the cluster set, or adds a resource that is not already a member of the cluster set. You can see if the resource is already a member of a cluster set by viewing the details of the managed cluster.   

**Note:** If you are moving a managed cluster from one managed cluster set to another, you must have the required RBAC permissions on both managed cluster sets.

== Removing clusters from a ManagedClusterSet by using the command line

To remove a managed cluster from a managed cluster set by using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command to display a list of managed clusters in the managed cluster set:
+
----
oc get managedclusters -l cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=<clusterset1>
----
+
Replace `clusterset1` with the name of the managed cluster set.

. Locate the entry for the cluster that you want to remove.

. Remove the label from the the `yaml` entry for the cluster that you want to remove. See the following code for an example of the label:

+
[source,yaml]
----
labels:
   cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: clusterset1
----

*Note:* If you are moving a managed cluster from one managed cluster set to another, you must have the required RBAC permission available on both managed cluster sets.
