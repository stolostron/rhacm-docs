= Troubleshooting reinstallation failure

When reinstalling multicluster engine, the pods do not start.

[#symptom-reinstallation-failure-mce]
== Symptom: Reinstallation failure

If your pods do not start after you install multicluster engine, it is likely that multicluster engine was previously installed, and not all of the pieces were removed before you attempted this installation. 

In this case, the pods do not start after completing the installation process. 

[#resolving-the-problem-reinstallation-failure-mce]
== Resolving the problem: Reinstallation failure

If you have this problem, complete the following steps: 

. Run the uninstallation process to remove the current components by following the steps in xref:../install_upgrade/uninstall.adoc#uninstalling-mce[Uninstalling].

. Install the Helm CLI binary version 3.2.0, or later, by following the instructions at https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Installing Helm].

. Ensure that your {ocp} CLI is configured to run `oc` commands. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information about how to configure the `oc` commands. 

. Copy the following script into a file:
+
----
#!/bin/bash
MCE_NAMESPACE=<namespace>
oc delete multiclusterengine --all
oc delete apiservice v1.admission.cluster.open-cluster-management.io v1.admission.work.open-cluster-management.io
oc delete crd discoveredclusters.discovery.open-cluster-management.io discoveryconfigs.discovery.open-cluster-management.io 
oc delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration ocm-mutating-webhook managedclustermutators.admission.cluster.open-cluster-management.io 
oc delete validatingwebhookconfiguration ocm-validating-webhook
oc delete ns $MCE_NAMESPACE
----
+
Replace `<namespace>` in the script with the name of the namespace where multicluster engine was installed. Ensure that you specify the correct namespace, as the namespace is cleaned out and deleted. 

. Run the script to remove the artifacts from the previous installation. 

. Run the installation. See xref:../install_upgrade/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online-mce[Installing while connected online].
