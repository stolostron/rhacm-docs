== Identifying the problem: Cluster with pending import status

. Run the following command on the managed cluster to view the Kubernetes pod names that are having the issue:
+
----
kubectl get pod -n open-cluster-management-agent | grep klusterlet-registration-agent
----

. Run the following command on the managed cluster to find the log entry for the error:
+
----
kubectl logs <registration_agent_pod> -n open-cluster-management-agent
----
+
Replace _registration_agent_pod_ with the pod name that you identified in step 1.

. Search the returned results for text that indicates there was a networking connectivity problem.
Example includes: `no such host`.

== Resolving the problem: Cluster with pending import status

. Retrieve the port number that is having the problem by entering the following command on the hub cluster:
+
----
oc get infrastructure cluster -o yaml | grep apiServerURL
----

. Ensure that the hostname from the managed cluster can be resolved, and that outbound connectivity to the host and port is occurring.
+
If the communication cannot be established by the managed cluster, the cluster import is not complete.
The cluster status for the managed cluster is _Pending import_.
