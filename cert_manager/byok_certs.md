# Replacing certificates

You can replace certain certificates that are created by the installer in your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes environment.

- [Root CA certificates](cert_root_ca.md) 
- [Management ingress certificates](cert_mgmt_ingress.md)

**Required user type or access level**: Cluster administrator or team administrator

**Note**: Replacing certificates is supported only on native Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes installations.
