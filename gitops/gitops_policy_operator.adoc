= Generating a policy to install GitOps Operator

A common use of {product-title-short} policies is to install an Operator on one or more managed {ocp} clusters. Continue reading to learn how to generate policies by using the Policy Generator, and to install the {ocp-short} GitOps Operator with a generated policy:

== Generating a policy that installs {ocp-short} GitOps

You can generate a policy that installs {ocp-short} GitOps by using the Policy Generator. The {ocp-short} GitOps operator offers the _all namespaces_ installation mode, which you can view in the following example. Create a `Subscription` manifest file called `openshift-gitops-subscription.yaml`, similar to the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----

To pin to a specific version of the operator, add the following parameter and value: `spec.startingCSV: openshift-gitops-operator.v<version>`. Replace `<version>` with your preferred version.

A `PolicyGenerator` configuration file is required. Use the configuration file named `policy-generator-config.yaml` to generate a policy to install {ocp-short} GitOps on all {ocp-short} managed clusters. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PolicyGenerator
metadata:
  name: install-openshift-gitops
policyDefaults:
  namespace: policies
  placement:
    clusterSelectors:
      vendor: "OpenShift"
  remediationAction: enforce
policies:
  - name: install-openshift-gitops
    manifests:
      - path: openshift-gitops-subscription.yaml
----

The last required file is `kustomization.yaml`, which requires the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
generators:
  - policy-generator-config.yaml
----

The generated policy might resemble the following file with `PlacementRule`(Deprecated):

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementRule
metadata:
  name: placement-install-openshift-gitops
  namespace: policies
spec:
  clusterConditions:
    - status: "True"
      type: ManagedClusterConditionAvailable
  clusterSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: vendor
        operator: In
        values:
          - OpenShift

              objectDefinition:

                kind: Subscription
                metadata:
                  name: openshift-gitops-operator
                  namespace: openshift-operators
                spec:
                  channel: stable

                  source: redhat-operators
                  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
          remediationAction: enforce
          severity: low
----

Generated policies from manifests in the {ocp-short} documentation is supported. Any configuration guidance from the {ocp-short} documentation can be applied using the Policy Generator.

[#policy-gen-install-compliance-operator]
== Generating a policy that installs the Compliance Operator

For an operator that uses the _namespaced_ installation mode, such as the Compliance Operator, an `OperatorGroup` manifest is also required. 

Create a YAML file with a `Namespace`, a `Subscription`, and an `OperatorGroup` manifest called `compliance-operator.yaml`. The following example installs these manifests in the `compliance-operator` namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-compliance
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
    - compliance-operator
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  channel: release-0.1
  name: compliance-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----

A `PolicyGenerator` configuration file is required. View the following `PolicyGenerator` policy example that installs the Compliance Operator on all {ocp-short} managed clusters:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PolicyGenerator
metadata:
  name: install-compliance-operator
policyDefaults:
  namespace: policies
  placement:
    clusterSelectors:
      vendor: "OpenShift"
  remediationAction: enforce
policies:
  - name: install-compliance-operator
    manifests:
      - path: compliance-operator.yaml
----

The last required file is `kustomization.yaml`, which requires the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
generators:
  - policy-generator-config.yaml
----

As a result, the generated policy resembles the following file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementRule
metadata:
  name: placement-install-compliance-operator
  namespace: policies
spec:

[#using-policy-dependencies-with-operatorgroups]
== Using policy dependencies with _OperatorGroups_

When you install an operator with an `OperatorGroup` manifest, the `OperatorGroup` must exist on the cluster before the `Subscription` is created. Use the policy dependency feature along with the Policy Generator to ensure that the `OperatorGroup` policy is compliant before you enforce the `Subscription` policy.

Set up policy dependencies by listing the manifests in the order that you want. For example, you might want to create the namespace policy first, create the `OperatorGroup` next, and create the `Subscription` last. 

Enable the `policyDefaults.orderManifests` parameter and disable `policyDefaults.consolidateManifests` in the Policy Generator configuration manifest to automatically set up dependencies between the manifests.
