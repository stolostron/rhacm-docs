[#gitops-console]
= GitOps console

Learn more about integrated {ocp-short} GitOps console features. Create and view applications, such as _ApplicationSet_, and _Argo CD_ types. An `ApplicationSet` represents Argo applications that are generated from the controller. 

- For an Argo CD `ApplicationSet` to be created, you need to enable `Automatically sync when cluster state changes` from the `Sync policy`.

- For Flux with the `kustomization` controller, find Kubernetes resources with the label `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name=<app_name>`.
    
- For Flux with the `helm` controller, find Kubernetes resources with the label `helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name=<app_name>`.
    
- You need GitOps cluster resources and the GitOps operator installed to create an `ApplicationSet`. Without these prerequisites, you will see no *Argo server* options in the console to create an `ApplicationSet`.

*Important:* Available actions are based on your assigned role. Learn about access requirements from the link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] documentation.

- Click *Launch resource in Search* to search for related resources.

- Use _Search_ to find application resources by the component `kind` for each resource. To search for resources, use the following values:

[#querying-argo-apps]
== Querying Argo CD applications

When you search for an Argo CD application, you are directed to the _Applications_ page. Complete the following steps to access the Argo CD application from the _Search_ page:

. Log in to your {product-title-short} hub cluster.
. From the console header, select the _Search_ icon.
. Filter your query with the following values: `kind:application` and `apigroup:argoproj.io`.
. Select an application to view. The _Application_ page displays an overview of information for the application.
