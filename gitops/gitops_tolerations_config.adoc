= Configuring application placement tolerations for GitOps
//Please review this file.

{acm-short} provides a way for you to register managed clusters that deploy applications to Red Hat OpenShift GitOps.

In some unstable network scenarios, the managed clusters might be temporarily placed in `Unavailable` state. If a `Placement` resource is being used to facilitate the deployment of applications, add the following tolerations for the `Placement` resource to continue to include unavailable clusters. The following example shows a `Placement` resource with tolerations:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/unreachable
      operator: Exists
    - key: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/unavailable
      operator: Exists
