= Creating a customized service account for Argo CD push model

Create a service account on a managed cluster by creating a `managedserviceaccount` resource on the hub cluster. Use the `clusterpermission` resource to grant specific permissions to the service account.

Creating a customzied service account for use with the Argo CD push model includes the following benefits: 

* An Application manager add-on runs on each managed cluster. By default, the Argo CD controller uses the service account Application manager to push these resources to the managed cluster. 
* The Application manager service account has a large set of permissions because the application subscription add-on uses the Application manager service to deploy applications on the managed cluster. Do not use the Application manager service account if you want a limited set of permissions. 
* You can specify a different service account that you want the Argo CD push model to use. When the Argo CD controller pushes resources from the centralized hub cluster to the managed cluster, you can use a different service account than the default Application manager. By using a different service account, you can control the permissions that are granted to this service account. 
* The service account must exist on the managed cluster. To facilitate the creation of the service account with the associated permissions, use the `managedserviceaccount` resource and the new `clusterpermission` resource on the centralized hub cluster. 

After completing all the following procedures, you can grant cluster permissions to your managed service account. Having the cluster permissions, your managed service account has the necessary permissions to deploy your application resources on the managed clusters. Complete the following procedures:

. <<Creating a managed service account>> 
. <<Creating a cluster permission>> 
. <<Using a managed service account in the GitOpsCluster resource>> 
. <<Creating an Argo CD application>> 
. <<Using policy to create managed service accounts and cluster permissions>>

== Creating a managed service account 

The `managedserviceaccount` custom resource on the hub provides a convenient way to create `serviceaccounts` on the managed clusters. When a `managedserviceccount` custom resource is created in the `<managed_cluster>` namespace on the hub cluster, a `serviceccount` is created on the managed cluster.

To create a managed service account, see link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/addon_managed_service.adoc#managed-serviceaccount-addon[Enabling managedserviceaccount add-ons].

== Creating a cluster permission 

When the service account is created, it does not have any permission associated to it. To grant permissions to the new service account, use the `clusterpermission` resource. The `clusterpermission` resource is created in the managed cluster namespace on the hub. It provides a convenient way to create roles, cluster roles resources on the managed clusters, and bind them to a service account through a `rolebinding` or `clusterrolebinding` resource.

. To grant the `<managed-sa-sample>` service account permission to the sample mortgage application that is deployed to the mortgage namespace on `<managed cluster>`, create a YAML with the following content:

----

. Save the YAML file in a file called, `cluster-permission.yaml`.
. Run `oc apply -f cluster-permission.yaml`. 
. The sample `<clusterpermission>` creates a role called `<clusterpermission-msa-subject-sample>` in the mortgage namespace. If one does not already exist, create a namespace `mortgage`. 
. Review the resources that are created on the `<managed cluster>`. 

After you create the sample, `<clusterpermission>`, the following resources are created in the sample managed cluster:

* One role called `<clusterpermission-msa-subject-sample>` in the default namespace.
* One roleBinding called `<clusterpermission-msa-subject-sample>` in the default namespace for binding the role to the managed service account. 
* One role called `<clusterpermission-msa-subject-sample>` in the mortgage namespace.
* One roleBinding called `<clusterpermission-msa-subject-sample>` in the mortgage namespace for binding the role to the managed service account.
* One clusterRole called `<clusterpermission-msa-subject-sample>`. 
* One clusterRoleBinding called `<clusterpermission-msa-subject-sample>` for binding the clusterRole to the managed service account. 

== Using a managed service account in the GitOpsCluster resource

The GitOpsCluster resource uses placement to import selected managed clusters into the Argo CD, including the creation of the Argo CD cluster secrets which contains information used to access the clusters. By default, the Argo CD cluster secret uses the application manager service account to access the managed clusters. 

. To update the GitOpsCluster resource to use the managed service account , add the `managedServiceAccountRef` property with the name of the managed service account. 
. To create a GitOpsCluster custom resource, save the following YAML as a Gitops.YAML: 

+
[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: argo-acm-importer
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  managedServiceAccountRef: <managed-sa-sample>
  argoServer:
    cluster: notused
    argoNamespace: openshift-gitops
  placementRef:
    kind: Placement
    apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
    name: all-openshift-clusters
    namespace: openshift-gitops
----

. Save the YAML file in a file called, `gitops.yaml`.
. Run `oc apply -f gitops.yaml`. 
. Go to the `openshift-gitops` namespace and verify that there is a new Argo CD cluster secret with the name `<managed cluster-managed-sa-sample-cluster-secret>`:

+
[source,yaml]
----
% oc get secrets -n openshift-gitops <managed cluster-managed-sa-sample-cluster-secret>

<managed cluster-managed-sa-sample-cluster-secret>   Opaque   3      4m2s
----

== Creating an Argo CD application 

Deploy an Argo CD application from the Argo CD console by using the pushing model. The Argo CD application is deployed with the managed service account, `<managed-sa-sample>`. 

. Log into the Argo CD console. 
. Click *Create a new application*. 
. Choose the cluster URL. 
. Go to your Argo CD application and verify that it has the given permissions, like roles and cluster roles, that you propagated to `<managed cluster>`. 

== Using policy to create managed service accounts and cluster permissions 

 When the GitOpsCluster resource is updated with the `managedServiceAccountRef`, each managed cluster in the placement of this GitOpsCluster needs to have the service account. If you have several managed clusters, it becomes tedious for you to create the managed service account and cluster permission for each managed cluster. You can simply this process by using a policy to create the managed service account and cluster permission for all your managed clusters

When you apply the `managedServiceAccount` and `clusterPermission` resources to the hub cluster, the placement of this policy is bound to the local cluster. Replicate those resources to the managed cluster namespace for all of the managed clusters in the placement of the GitOpsCluster resource.

Using a policy to create the `managedServiceAccount` and `clusterPermission` resources include the following attributes: 

* Updating the `managedServiceAccount` and `clusterPermission` object templates in the policy results in updates to all of the `managedServiceAccount` and `clusterPermission` resources in all of the managed clusters.
* Updating directly to the `managedServiceAccount` and `clusterPermission` resources becomes reverted back to the original state because it is enforced by the policy.
* If the placement decision for the GitOpsCluster placement changes, the policy manages the creation and deletion of the resources in the managed cluster namespaces.

. To create a policy for a YAML to create a managed service account and cluster permission, create a YAML with the following content:
