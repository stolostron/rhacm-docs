= Generating a policy to install GitOps Operator

A common use of {acm-short} policies is to install an Operator on one or more managed {ocp} clusters. Continue reading to learn how to generate policies by using the Policy Generator, and to install the {ocp-short} GitOps Operator with a generated policy:

[#policy-install-ocp-gitops]
== Generating a policy that installs {ocp-short} GitOps

You can generate a policy that installs {ocp-short} GitOps by using the Policy Generator. The {ocp-short} GitOps operator offers the _all namespaces_ installation mode, which you can view in the following example. Create a `Subscription` manifest file called `openshift-gitops-subscription.yaml`, similar to the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----

To pin to a specific version of the operator, add the following parameter and value: `spec.startingCSV: openshift-gitops-operator.v<version>`. Replace `<version>` with your preferred version.

A `PolicyGenerator` configuration file is required. Use the configuration file named `policy-generator-config.yaml` to generate a policy to install {ocp-short} GitOps on all {ocp-short} managed clusters. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PolicyGenerator
metadata:
  name: install-openshift-gitops
policyDefaults:
  namespace: policies
  placement:
    clusterSelectors:
      vendor: "OpenShift"
  remediationAction: enforce
policies:
  - name: install-openshift-gitops
    manifests:
      - path: openshift-gitops-subscription.yaml
----

The last required file is `kustomization.yaml`, which requires the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
generators:
  - policy-generator-config.yaml
----

The generated policy might resemble the following file with `PlacementRule`(Deprecated):

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementRule
metadata:
  name: placement-install-openshift-gitops
  namespace: policies
spec:
  clusterConditions:
    - status: "True"
      type: ManagedClusterConditionAvailable
  clusterSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: vendor
        operator: In
        values:
          - OpenShift
---

Generated policies from manifests in the {ocp-short} documentation is supported. Any configuration guidance from the {ocp-short} documentation can be applied using the Policy Generator.

[#using-policy-dependencies-with-operatorgroups]
== Using policy dependencies with _OperatorGroups_

When you install an operator with an `OperatorGroup` manifest, the `OperatorGroup` must exist on the cluster before the `Subscription` is created. Use the policy dependency feature along with the Policy Generator to ensure that the `OperatorGroup` policy is compliant before you enforce the `Subscription` policy.

Set up policy dependencies by listing the manifests in the order that you want. For example, you might want to create the namespace policy first, create the `OperatorGroup` next, and create the `Subscription` last. 

Enable the `policyDefaults.orderManifests` parameter and disable `policyDefaults.consolidateManifests` in the Policy Generator configuration manifest to automatically set up dependencies between the manifests.
