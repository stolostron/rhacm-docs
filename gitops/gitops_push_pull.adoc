[#gitops-push-pull]
= Deploying Argo CD with Push and Pull model

Using a _Push model_, The Argo CD server on the hub cluster deploys the application resources on the managed clusters. For the _Pull model_(Technology Preview), the application resources are propagated by the _Propagation controller_ to the managed clusters by using `manifestWork`.

*Technology Preview:* Pull model has limited support this release.

For both models, the same `ApplicationSet` CRD is used to deploy the application to the managed cluster.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#prereqs-pull-model]
== Prerequisites

* *Important:* If your `openshift-gitops-ArgoCD-application-controller` service account is _not_ assigned as a cluster administrator, the GitOps application controller might not deploy resources. The application status might send an error similar to the following error:

----
cannot create resource "services" in API group "" in the namespace
"mortgage",deployments.apps is forbidden: User
"system:serviceaccount:openshift-gitops:openshift-gitops-Argo CD-application-controller"
----

* If you are not a cluster administrator and need to resolve this issue, complete the following steps:

. Create all namespaces on each managed cluster where the Argo CD application will be deployed.

. Add the `managed-by` label to each namespace. If an Argo CD application is deployed to multiple namespaces,
each namespace should be managed by Argo CD.

+
See the following example with the `managed-by` label:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: mortgage2
  labels:
    argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by: openshift-gitops
----

. You must declare all application destination namespaces in the repository for the application and include the `managed-by` label in the namespaces. Refer to _Additional resources_ to learn how to declare a namespace.

See the following requirements to use the Argo CD _Pull_ model:

- The GitOps operator must be installed on the hub cluster and the target managed clusters in the `openshift-gitops` namespace.

- The required hub cluster {ocp-short} GitOps operator must be version 1.9.0 or later.

- The required managed clusters {ocp-short} GitOps operator must be the same version as the hub cluster.

- You need the _ApplicationSet controller_ to propagate the Argo CD application template for a managed cluster.

- Every managed cluster must have a cluster secret in the Argo CD server namespace on the hub cluster, which is required by the ArgoCD application set controller to propagate the Argo CD application template for a managed cluster.

+
To create the cluster secret, create a `gitOpsCluster` resource that contains a reference to a `placement` resource. The `placement` resource selects all the managed clusters that need to support the Pull model. When the GitOps cluster controller reconciles, it creates the cluster secrets for the managed clusters in the Argo CD server namespace.

[#arch-push-pull]
== Architecture

For both Push and Pull model, the _Argo CD ApplicationSet controller_ on the hub cluster reconciles to create application resources for each target managed cluster. See the following information about architecture for both models:

[#arch-push]
=== Architecture Push model

- With Push model, {ocp-short} GitOps applies resources _directly_ from a centralized hub cluster to the managed clusters.

- An Argo CD application that is running on the hub cluster communicates with the GitHub repository and deploys the manifests directly to the managed clusters.

- Push model implementation only contains the Argo CD application on the hub cluster, which has credentials for managed clusters. The Argo CD application on the hub cluster can deploy the applications to the managed clusters.

- *Important:* With a large number of managed clusters that require resource application, consider potential strain on the {ocp-short} GitOps controller memory and CPU usage. To optimize resource management, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/cicd/gitops#configuring-resource-quota[Configuring resource quota or requests].

- By default, the Push model is used to deploy the application unless you add the `apps.open-cluster-management.io/ocm-managed-cluster` and `apps.open-cluster-management.io/pull-to-ocm-managed-cluster` annotations to the template section of the `ApplicationSet`.

[#arch-pull]
=== Architecture Pull model (Technology Preview)

- Pull model can provide scalability relief compared to the push model by reducing stress on the controller in the hub cluster, but with more requests and status reporting required.

- With Pull model, {ocp-short} GitOps _does not_ apply resources directly from a centralized hub cluster to the managed clusters. The Argo CD Application is propagated from the hub cluster to the managed clusters.

- Pull model implementation applies {ocm} registration, placement, and `manifestWork` APIs so that the hub cluster can use the secure communication channel between the hub cluster and the managed cluster to deploy resources.

- Each managed cluster individually communicates with the GitHub repository to deploy the resource manifests locally, so you must install and configure GitOps operators on each managed cluster.

- An Argo CD server must be running on each target managed cluster. The Argo CD application resources are replicated on the managed clusters, which are then deployed by the local Argo CD server. The distributed Argo CD applications on the managed clusters are created with a single Argo CD `ApplicationSet` resource on the hub cluster.

- The managed cluster is determined by the value of the `ocm-managed-cluster` annotation.

- For successful implementation of Pull model, the Argo CD application controller must _ignore_ Push model application resources with the `argocd.argoproj.io/skip-reconcile` annotation in the template section of the `ApplicationSet`.

- For Pull model, the _Argo CD Application controller_ on the managed cluster reconciles to deploy the application.

- The Pull model _Resource sync controller_ on the hub cluster queries the {ocm} search V2 component on each managed cluster periodically to retrieve the resource list and error messages for each Argo CD application.

- The _Aggregation controller_ on the hub cluster creates and updates the `MulticlusterApplicationSetReport` from across clusters by using the data from the Resource sync controller, and the status information from `manifestWork`.

- The status of the deployments is gathered back to the hub cluster, but not all the detailed information is transmitted. Additional status updates are periodically scraped to provide an overview. The status feedback is not real-time, and each managed cluster GitOps operator needs to communicate with the Git repository, which results in multiple requests.

[#crd-pull-model]
== Creating the _ApplicationSet_ custom resource

The Argo CD `ApplicationSet` resource is used to deploy applications on the managed clusters by using the Push or Pull model with a `placement` resource in the generator field that is used to get a list of managed clusters. 

. For the Pull model, set the destination for the application to the default local Kubernetes server, as displayed in the following example. The application is deployed locally by the application controller on the managed cluster.

. Add the annotations that are required to override the default Push model, as displayed in the following example `ApplicationSet` YAML, which uses the Pull model with template annotations:

<1> The `apps.open-cluster-management.io/ocm-managed-cluster` is needed for the Pull model.
<2> The `argocd.argoproj.io/skip-reconcile` is needed to ignore the Push model resources.

[#status-report]
== _MulticlusterApplicationSetReport_

- For the Pull model, the `MulticlusterApplicationSetReport` aggregates application status from across your managed clusters.

- The report includes the list of resources and the overall status of the application from each managed cluster.

- A separate report resource is created for each Argo CD ApplicationSet resource. The report is created in the same namespace as the `ApplicationSet`.

- The report includes the following items:

+
. A list of resources for the Argo CD application
. The overall sync and health status for each Argo CD application
. An error message for each cluster where the overall status is `out of sync` or `unhealthy`
. A summary status all the states of your managed clusters

- The _Resource sync controller_ and the _Aggregation controller_ both run every 10 seconds to create the report.

- The two controllers, along with the Propagation controller, run in separate containers in the same `multicluster-integrations` pod, as shown in the following example output:

+
----
