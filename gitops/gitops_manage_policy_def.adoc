[#gitops-policy-definitions]
= Managing policy definitions with {ocp-short} GitOps (Argo CD)

*Deprecated:* `PlacementRule`

{ocp-short} GitOps, based on Argo CD, can also be used to manage policy definitions. To allow this workflow, {ocp-short} GitOps must be granted access to create policies on the {product-title-short} hub cluster. Create the following `ClusterRole` resource called `openshift-gitops-policy-admin`, with access to create, read, update, and delete policies and placements. Your `ClusterRole` might resemble the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
rules:
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create

    resources:

Create a `ClusterRoleBinding` object to grant the {ocp-short} GitOps service account access to the `openshift-gitops-policy-admin` `ClusterRole` object. Your `ClusterRoleBinding` might resemble the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller
    namespace: openshift-gitops
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
----

When a {product-title-short} policy definition is deployed with {ocp-short} GitOps, a copy of the policy is created in each managed cluster namespace. These copies are called replicated policies. To prevent {ocp-short} GitOps from repeatedly deleting this replicated policy or show that the ArgoCD `Application` is out of sync, the `argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options: IgnoreExtraneous` annotation is automatically set on each replicated policy by the {product-title-short} policy framework.

There are labels and annotations used by ArgoCD to track objects. For replicated policies to not show up at all in ArgoCD, you can set `spec.copyPolicyMetadata` to `false` on the {product-title-short} policy definition to prevent these ArgoCD tracking labels and annotations from being copied to the replicated policy.

== Integrating the Policy Generator with {ocp-short} GitOps (Argo CD)

{ocp-short} GitOps, based on ArgoCD, can also be used to generate policies by using the Policy Generator through GitOps. Since the Policy Generator does not come preinstalled in the {ocp-short} GitOps container image, some customization must take place. In order to follow along, you must have the {ocp-short} GitOps Operator installed on the {product-title-short} hub cluster and be sure to log in to the hub cluster.

For {ocp-short} GitOps to have access to the Policy Generator when you run Kustomize, an Init Container is required to copy the Policy Generator binary from the {product-title-short} Application Subscription container image to the {ocp-short} GitOps container. Additionally, {ocp-short} GitOps must be configured to provide the `--enable-alpha-plugins` flag when it runs Kustomize. Start editing the {ocp-short} GitOps `argocd` object with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
oc -n openshift-gitops edit argocd openshift-gitops
----

Then modify the {ocp-short} GitOps `argocd` object to contain the following additional YAML content. When a new major version of {product-title-short} is released and you want to update the Policy Generator to a newer version, you need to update the `registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel8` image used by the Init Container to a newer tag. View the following example and replace `<version>` with {product-version} or your desired {product-title-short} version:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  kustomizeBuildOptions: --enable-alpha-plugins
  repo:
    env:
    - name: KUSTOMIZE_PLUGIN_HOME
      value: /etc/kustomize/plugin
    initContainers:
    - args:
      - -c
      - cp /etc/kustomize/plugin/policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1/policygenerator/PolicyGenerator
        /policy-generator/PolicyGenerator
      command:
      - /bin/bash
      image: registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel8:v<version>
      name: policy-generator-install
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /policy-generator
        name: policy-generator
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /etc/kustomize/plugin/policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1/policygenerator
      name: policy-generator
    volumes:
    - emptyDir: {}
      name: policy-generator
----

Now that {ocp-short} GitOps can use the Policy Generator, {ocp-short} GitOps must be granted access to create policies on the {product-title-short} hub cluster. Create the `ClusterRole` resource called `openshift-gitops-policy-admin`, with access to create, read, update, and delete policies and placements. Refer to the ealier `ClusterRole` example.

Additionally, create a `ClusterRoleBinding` object to grant the {ocp-short} GitOps service account access to the `openshift-gitops-policy-admin` `ClusterRole`. Your `ClusterRoleBinding` might resemble the following resource:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller
    namespace: openshift-gitops
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
