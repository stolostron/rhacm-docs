[#gitops-policy-definitions]
= Managing policy definitions with {gitops} 

With the `ArgoCD` resource, you can use {gitops} to manage policy definitions by granting {gitops-short} access to create policies on the {acm-short} hub cluster.

[#gitops-pol-def-prereq]
== Prerequisite

You must log in to your hub cluster.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

*Deprecated:* `PlacementRule`

[#create-clusterrole-gitops]
== Creating a _ClusterRole_ resource for {gitops-short}

To create a `ClusterRole` resource for {gitops-short}, with access to create, read, update, and delete policies and placements:

. Create a `ClusterRole` from the console. Your `ClusterRole` might resemble the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
rules:
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - policy.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - policies
      - policysets
      - placementbindings
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - apps.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - placementrules
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - cluster.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - placements
      - placements/status
      - placementdecisions
      - placementdecisions/status
----

. Create a `ClusterRoleBinding` object to grant the {gitops-short} service account access to the `openshift-gitops-policy-admin` `ClusterRole` object. Your `ClusterRoleBinding` might resemble the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller
    namespace: openshift-gitops
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
----
+
*Notes:* 
- When a {acm-short} policy definition is deployed with {gitops-short}, a copy of the policy is created in each managed cluster namespace for resolving hub template differences. These copies are called replicated policies.
- To prevent {gitops-short} from repeatedly deleting this replicated policy or show that the Argo CD `Application` is out of sync, the `argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options: IgnoreExtraneous` annotation is automatically set on each replicated policy by the {acm-short} policy framework.

. There are labels and annotations used by Argo CD to track objects. For replicated policies to not show up at all in Argo CD, disable the Argo CD tracking labels and annotations by setting `spec.copyPolicyMetadata` to `false` on the {acm-short} policy definition.

[#integrate-pol-gen-ocp-gitops]
== Integrating the Policy Generator with {gitops-short}

You can use {gitops-short} to generate policies by using the Policy Generator through GitOps. Since the Policy Generator does not come preinstalled in the {gitops-short} container image, you must complete customizations. 

[#integrate-pol-gen-prereq]
=== Prerequisites

* You must install {gitops-short} on your {acm-short} hub cluster.
* You must log in to the hub cluster.

[#access-policy-gen-gitops]
=== Accessing the Policy Generator from {gitops-short}

To access the Policy Generator from {gitops-short}, you must configure the Init Container to copy the Policy Generator binary from the {acm-short} Application Subscription container image. You must also configure {gitops-short} by providing the `--enable-alpha-plugins` flag when it runs Kustomize.

To create, read, update, and delete policies and placements with the Policy Generator, grant access to the Policy Generator from {gitops-short}. Complete the following steps:

. Edit the {gitops-short} `argocd` object with the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc -n openshift-gitops edit argocd openshift-gitops
----

. To update the Policy Generator to a newer version, add the `registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel9` image used by the Init Container to a newer tag. Replace the `<version>` parameter with the latest {acm-short} version in your `ArgoCD` resource.
+
Your `ArgoCD` resource might resemble the following YAML file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1beta1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  kustomizeBuildOptions: --enable-alpha-plugins
  repo:
    env:
    - name: KUSTOMIZE_PLUGIN_HOME
      value: /etc/kustomize/plugin
    initContainers:
    - args:
      - -c
      - cp /policy-generator/PolicyGenerator-not-fips-compliant /policy-generator-tmp/PolicyGenerator
      command:
      - /bin/bash
      image: registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel9:v<version>
      name: policy-generator-install
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /policy-generator-tmp
        name: policy-generator
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /etc/kustomize/plugin/policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1/policygenerator
      name: policy-generator
    volumes:
    - emptyDir: {}
      name: policy-generator
----
+
*Note:* Alternatively, you can create a `ConfigurationPolicy` resource that contains the `ArgoCD` manifest and template the version to match the version set in the `MulticlusterHub`:

+
[source,yaml]
----
image: '{{ (index (lookup "apps/v1" "Deployment" "open-cluster-management" "multicluster-operators-hub-subscription").spec.template.spec.containers 0).image }}'
----

. If you want to enable the processing of Helm charts within the Kustomize directory before generating policies, set the `POLICY_GEN_ENABLE_HELM` environment variable to `"true"` in the `spec.repo.env` field:

+
[source,yaml]
----
env:
- name: POLICY_GEN_ENABLE_HELM
  value: "true"
----

. To create, read, update, and delete policies and placements, create a `ClusterRoleBinding` object to grant the {gitops-short} service account access to {acm-short} hub cluster. Your `ClusterRoleBinding` might resemble the following resource:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller
    namespace: openshift-gitops
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
