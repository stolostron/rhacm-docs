[#gitops-pol-def-prereq]
== Prerequisite

You must log in to your hub cluster.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

*Deprecated:* `PlacementRule`

[#create-clusterrole-gitops]
== Creating a _ClusterRole_ resource for Red Hat OpenShift GitOps

To create a `ClusterRole` resource for Red Hat OpenShift GitOps, with access to create, read, update, and delete policies and placements:

. Create a `ClusterRole` from the console. Your `ClusterRole` might resemble the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
rules:
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - policy.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - policies
      - configurationpolicies
      - certificatepolicies
      - operatorpolicies
      - policysets
      - placementbindings
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - apps.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - placementrules
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - cluster.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - placements
      - placements/status
      - placementdecisions
      - placementdecisions/status
----

. Create a `ClusterRoleBinding` object to grant the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps service account access to the `openshift-gitops-policy-admin` `ClusterRole` object. Your `ClusterRoleBinding` might resemble the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller
    namespace: openshift-gitops
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
----
+
*Notes:* 
- When a {acm-short} policy definition is deployed with Red Hat OpenShift GitOps, a copy of the policy is created in each managed cluster namespace for resolving hub template differences. These copies are called replicated policies.
- To prevent Red Hat OpenShift GitOps from repeatedly deleting this replicated policy or show that the Argo CD `Application` is out of sync, the `argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options: IgnoreExtraneous` annotation is automatically set on each replicated policy by the {acm-short} policy framework.

. There are labels and annotations used by Argo CD to track objects. For replicated policies to not show up at all in Argo CD, disable the Argo CD tracking labels and annotations by setting `spec.copyPolicyMetadata` to `false` on the {acm-short} policy definition.

[#integrate-pol-gen-ocp-gitops]
== Integrating the Policy Generator with Red Hat OpenShift GitOps

You can use Red Hat OpenShift GitOps to generate policies by using the Policy Generator through GitOps. Since the Policy Generator does not come preinstalled in the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps container image, you must complete customizations. 

[#integrate-pol-gen-prereq]
=== Prerequisites

* You must have the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps installed on the {acm-short} hub cluster.
* You must log in to the hub cluster.

[#access-policy-gen-gitops]
== Accessing the Policy Generator from Red Hat OpenShift GitOps

To access the Policy Generator from Red Hat OpenShift GitOps, you must configure the Init Container to copy the Policy Generator binary from the {acm-short} Application Subscription container image. You must also configure Red Hat OpenShift GitOps by providing the `--enable-alpha-plugins` flag when it runs Kustomize.

To create, read, update, and delete policies and placements with the Policy Generator, grant access to the Policy Generator from Red Hat OpenShift GitOps. Complete the following steps:

. Edit the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps `argocd` object with the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc -n openshift-gitops edit argocd openshift-gitops
----

. To update the Policy Generator to a newer version, add the `registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel9` image used by the Init Container to a newer tag. Replace the `<version>` parameter with the latest {acm-short} version in your `ArgoCD` resource.
+
Your `ArgoCD` resource might resemble the following YAML file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1beta1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  kustomizeBuildOptions: --enable-alpha-plugins
  repo:
    env:
    - name: KUSTOMIZE_PLUGIN_HOME
      value: /etc/kustomize/plugin
    initContainers:
    - args:
      - -c
      - cp /policy-generator/PolicyGenerator-not-fips-compliant /policy-generator-tmp/PolicyGenerator
      command:
      - /bin/bash
      image: registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel9:v<version>
      name: policy-generator-install
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /policy-generator-tmp
        name: policy-generator
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /etc/kustomize/plugin/policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1/policygenerator
      name: policy-generator
    volumes:
    - emptyDir: {}
      name: policy-generator
----
+
*Note:* Alternatively, you can create a `ConfigurationPolicy` resource that contains the `ArgoCD` manifest and template the version to match the version set in the `MulticlusterHub`:

+
[source,yaml]
----
image: '{{ (index (lookup "apps/v1" "Deployment" "open-cluster-management" "multicluster-operators-hub-subscription").spec.template.spec.containers 0).image }}'
----

. If you want to enable the processing of Helm charts within the Kustomize directory before generating policies, set the `POLICY_GEN_ENABLE_HELM` environment variable to `"true"` in the `spec.repo.env` field:

+
[source,yaml]
----
env:
- name: POLICY_GEN_ENABLE_HELM
  value: "true"
----

. To create, read, update, and delete policies and placements, create a `ClusterRoleBinding` object to grant the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps service account access to {acm-short} hub cluster. Your `ClusterRoleBinding` might resemble the following resource:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller
    namespace: openshift-gitops
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
----

[#config-gitops-healthcheck]
== Configuring policy health checks in Red Hat OpenShift GitOps

With the `ArgoCD` resoure, use Red Hat OpenShift GitOps for you to define custom logic that determines the current health of specific resource based on the resource state. Define custom health checks to report the policy as healthy only when your policy is compliant. When you add a health check for a resource, you must add it as a `group` in the `resourceHealthChecks` field. 

*Important:* To verify that you did not download something malicious from the Internet, review every policy before you apply it.

To define health checks for your resource kinds complete the following steps:

. To configure the health check for your `CertificatePolicy` resources, edit the `ArgoCD` resource with the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc -n openshift-gitops edit argocd openshift-gitops
----
+
Your `ArgoCD` resource might resemble the following YAML file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1beta1 
kind: ArgoCD 
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec: 
  resourceHealthChecks: 
    - group: policy.open-cluster-management.io 
      kind: CertificatePolicy 
      check: | 
	hs = {} 
	if obj.status == nil or obj.status.compliant == nil then
	  hs.status = "Progressing" 
	  hs.message = "Waiting for the status to be reported" 
	  return hs 
	end 
	if obj.status.compliant == "Compliant" then 
	  hs.status = "Healthy" hs.message = "All certificates found comply with the policy" 
	  return hs 
	else hs.status = "Degraded" 
          hs.message = "At least one certificate does not comply with the policy"
	  return hs 
        end
----

. To add a health check to your `CertificatePolicy`, `ConfigurationPolicy`, `OperatorPolicy`, and `Policy` resources, download the `argocd-policy-healthchecks.yaml` by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-cluster-management-io/policy-collection/main/stable/CM-Configuration-Management/argocd-policy-healthchecks.yaml
----

. To apply the `argocd-policy-healthchecks.yaml` policy, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f ./argocd-policy-healthchecks.yaml
----

. Verify that the health checks work as expected by viewing the _Summary_ tab of the `ArgoCD` resource. View the health details from the Argo CD console.
