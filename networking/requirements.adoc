[#network-configuration-hub]
=== Hub cluster networking requirements

For the hub cluster networking requirements, see the following table:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound to managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Retrieval of logs dynamically from Search console for the pods of the managed cluster. This connection creates a route called `klusterlet-addon-workmgr` in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace of the managed cluster. The host of the route is `<route name>-<namespace>.apps.<cluster domain>`.
| 443

| Outbound to managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Kubernetes API server of the managed cluster that is provisioned during installation to install the Klusterlet
| 6443

| Outbound to the channel source
| HTTPS
| The channel source, including GitHub, Object Store, and Helm repository. This is only required when you are using Application lifecycle, OpenShift GitOps or ArgoCD to connect to these sources.
| 443

| Inbound from the managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Managed cluster to push metrics and alerts (alerts are gathered only for managed clusters running {ocp-short} version 4.8, or later)
| 443

| Inbound from the managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Kube API Server of hub cluster being watched for changes from managed cluster
| 6443

| Outbound to `ObjectStore`
| HTTPS
| Sends metric data of Observability for long term storage in the ObjectStore **and/or** when the Cluster Backup Operator is running.
| 443

| Outbound to image repository
| HTTPS
| Access images for {ocp-short} and {product-title-short} 
| 443

|===

[#network-configuration-managed]
=== Managed cluster networking requirements

*Note:* `Registration Agent` and `Work Agent` on the managed cluster do not support proxy settings because they communicate with `apiserver` on the hub cluster by establishing an mTLS connection, which cannot pass through the proxy.

For the managed cluster networking requirements, see the following table:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Inbound from the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Sending of logs dynamically for the pods of the managed cluster. This connection uses a service running on the managed cluster called - `klusterlet-addon-workmgr`
| 443

| Inbound from the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Kubernetes API server of the managed cluster that is provisioned during installation to install the Klusterlet
| 6443

| Outbound to image repository
| HTTPS
| Access images for {ocp-short} and {product-title-short} 
| 443

| Outbound to the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Managed cluster to push metrics and alerts (alerts are gathered only for managed clusters running {ocp-short} version 4.8, or later)
| 443

| Outbound to the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Watches the Kubernetes API server of the hub cluster for changes
| 6443

| Outbound to the channel source
| HTTPS
| The managed cluster to the channel source, which includes GitHub, Object Store, and Helm repository. This is only required when you are using application lifecycle to connect to these sources.
| 443

[#network-configuration-infra-operator]
=== Additional networking requirements when installing using the infrastructure operator

When you are installing bare metal managed clusters with the Infrastructure Operator, see the following table for the additional networking requirements:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Hub cluster outbound to the ISO/rootfs image repository
| HTTPS (HTTP in a disconnected environment
| Used to create an ISO image on the {product-title-short} hub
| 443 (80 in disconnected environments)

| Hub cluster outbound to BMC interface at single node {ocp-short} managed cluster
| HTTPS (HTTP in disconnected environment)
| Boot the {ocp-short} cluster
| 443

| Outbound from the {ocp-short} managed cluster to the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Reports hardware information using the `assistedService` route 
| 443

| Outbound from the {ocp-short} managed cluster to the ISO/rootfs image repository
| HTTP
| Downloads the rootfs image
| 80

|===

[#network-configuration-submariner]
=== Submariner networking requirements

Clusters that are using Submariner require three open ports. The following table shows which ports you might use:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound and inbound
| UDP
| Each of the managed clusters
| 4800

| Outbound and inbound
| UDP
| Each of the managed clusters
| 4500, 500, and any other ports that are used for IPSec traffic on the gateway nodes

| Inbound
| TCP
| Each of the managed clusters
| 8080

|===

[#network-configuration-hive]
=== Additional networking requirements when installing using the Hive Operator

When you are installing bare metal managed clusters with the Hive Operator, which includes using Central Infrastructure Management, you must configure a layer 2 or layer 3 port connection between the hub cluster and the `libvirt` provisioning host. This connection to the provisioning host is required during the creation of a base metal cluster with Hive. See the following table for more information:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Hub cluster outbound and inbound to the `libvirt` provisioning host
| IP
| Connects the hub cluster, where the Hive operator is installed, to the `libvirt` provisioning host that serves as a bootstrap when creating the bare metal cluster
| 

|===

**Note:** These requirements only apply when installing, and are not required when upgrading clusters that were installed with Infrastructure Operator.

[#network-configuration-app-deploy]
=== Application deployment network requirements

In general, the application deployment communication is one way from a managed cluster to the hub cluster. The connection uses `kubeconfig`, which is configured by the agent on the managed cluster. The application deployment on the managed cluster needs to access the following namespaces on the hub cluster:

* The namespace of the channel resource
* The namespace of the managed cluster

[#network-configuration-namespace]
=== Namespace connection network requirements

* Application lifecycle connections:
** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the console API on port 4000.
** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to expose the Application UI on port 3001.

* Application lifecycle backend components (pods):
+
On the hub cluster, all of the application lifecycle pods are installed in the `open-cluster-management` namespace, including the following pods:

** multicluster-operators-hub-subscription
** multicluster-operators-standalone-subscription
** multicluster-operators-channel
** multicluster-operators-application
** multicluster-integrations

+
As a result of these pods being in the `open-cluster-management` namespace:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.

+
On the managed cluster, only the `klusterlet-addon-appmgr` application lifecycle pod is installed in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.
    
* Governance and risk:
+
On the hub cluster, the following access is required:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.
** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the OpenShift DNS on port 5353.

+ 
On the managed cluster, the following access is required:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management-addon` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.
