[#hub-network-config]
= Hub cluster network configuration

**Important:** The trusted CA bundle is available in the {acm-short} namespace, but that enhancement requires changes to your network. The trusted CA bundle ConfigMap uses the default name of `trusted-ca-bundle`. You can change this name by providing it to the operator in an environment variable named `TRUSTED_CA_BUNDLE`. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.15/html/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy#nw-proxy-configure-object_config-cluster-wide-proxy[Configuring the cluster-wide proxy] in the _Networking_ section of {ocp} for more information.

You can refer to the configuration for your hub cluster network.
