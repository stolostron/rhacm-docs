= Uninstalling Submariner

You can uninstall the Submariner components from your clusters using the {product-title} console or the command-line. For Submariner versions earlier than 0.12, additional steps are needed to completely remove all data plane components. The Submariner uninstall is idempotent, so you can repeat steps without any issues.

== Verifying Submariner resource removal

After uninstalling Submariner, verify that all of the Submariner resources are removed from your clusters.

. Run the following command to list any Submariner resources that remain on the cluster:
+
----
oc get cluster <CLUSTER_NAME> grep submariner
----
+
Replace `CLUSTER_NAME` with the name of your cluster.

. Remove any resources on the list by entering the following command:
+
----
oc delete resource <RESOURCE_NAME> cluster <CLUSTER_NAME>
---- 
+
Replace `RESOURCE_NAME` with the name of the Submariner resource that you want to remove.

. Repeat steps 1-2 for each of the clusters until your search does not identify any resources. 

The Submariner resources are removed from your cluster.
