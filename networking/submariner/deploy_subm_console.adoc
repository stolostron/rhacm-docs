[#deploying-submariner-console]
= Deploying Submariner by using the console

Before you deploy Submariner with {acm}, you must prepare the clusters on the hosting environment. You can use the `SubmarinerConfig` API or the {acm} console to automatically prepare {ocp} clusters on the following providers:

* Amazon Web Services
* Google Cloud Platform
* IBM Power Systems Virtual Server
* Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (Technology Preview)
* Red Hat OpenStack Platform
* Microsoft Azure
* VMware vSphere

*Notes:*

* Only non-NSX deployments are supported on VMware vSphere.

* You must install the link:https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/operations/install-apiserver#install-the-api-server[Calico API server] on your cluster if you are using Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud. Alternatively, you can manually create the the IP pools required for cross-cluster communication by following the link:https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/calico/[CALICO CNI] topic in the Submariner upstream documentation.

To deploy Submariner on other providers, follow the instructions in xref:../submariner/deploy_subm_manual.adoc#deploying-submariner-manually[Deploying Submariner manually].

Complete the following steps to deploy Submariner with the {acm} console:

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

. From the console, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. On the _Clusters_ page, select the _Cluster sets_ tab. The clusters that you want enable with Submariner must be in the same cluster set. 

. If the clusters on which you want to deploy Submariner are already in the same cluster set, skip to step 5.

. If the clusters on which you want to deploy Submariner are not in the same cluster set, create a cluster set for them by completing the following steps: 

.. Select *Create cluster set*.

.. Name the cluster set, and select *Create*.

.. Select *Manage resource assignments* to assign clusters to the cluster set.

.. Select the managed clusters that you want to connect with Submariner to add them to the cluster set.

.. Select *Review* to view and confirm the clusters that you selected.

.. Select *Save* to save the cluster set, and view the resulting cluster set page.

. On the cluster set page, select the _Submariner add-ons_ tab.

. Select *Install Submariner add-ons*.

. Select the clusters on which you want to deploy Submariner. 

. See the fields in the following table and enter the required information in the _Install Submariner add-ons_ editor:

|===
| Field | Notes 

| `AWS Access Key ID`
| Only visible when you import an AWS cluster.

| `AWS Secret Access Key`
| Only visible when you import an AWS cluster.

| `Base domain resource group name`
| Only visible when you import an Azure cluster.

| `Client ID`
| Only visible when you import an Azure cluster.

| `Client secret`
| Only visible when you import an Azure cluster.

| `Subscription ID`
| Only visible when you import an Azure cluster.

| `Tenant ID`
| Only visible when you import an Azure cluster.

| `Google Cloud Platform service account JSON key`
| Only visible when you import a Google Cloud Platform cluster.

| `Instance type`
| The instance type of the gateway node that is created on the managed cluster.

| `IPsec NAT-T port`
| The default value for the IPsec NAT traversal port is port `4500`. If your managed cluster environment is VMware vSphere, ensure that this port is opened on your firewall.

| `Gateway count`
| The number of gateway nodes to be deployed on the managed cluster. For AWS, GCP, Azure, and OpenStack clusters, dedicated Gateway nodes are deployed. For VWware clusters, existing worker nodes are tagged as gateway nodes. The default value is `1`. If the value is greater than 1, the Submariner gateway High Availability (HA) is automatically enabled.

| `Cable driver`
| The Submariner gateway cable engine component that maintains the cross-cluster tunnels. The default value is `Libreswan IPsec`.

| `Disconnected cluster`
| If enabled, tells Submariner to not access any external servers for public IP resolution.

| Globalnet CIDR
| Only visible when the Globalnet configuration is selected on the cluster set. The Globalnet CIDR to be used for the managed cluster. If left blank, a CIDR is allocated from the cluster set pool.

. Select *Next* at the end of the editor to move to the editor for the next cluster, and complete the editor for each of the remaining clusters that you selected. 

. Verify your configuration for each managed cluster.

. Click *Install* to deploy Submariner on the selected managed clusters. 
+
It might take several minutes for the installation and configuration to complete. You can check the Submariner status in the list on the _Submariner add-ons_ tab:
+
* `Connection status` indicates how many Submariner connections are established on the managed cluster. 
+
* `Agent status` indicates whether Submariner is successfully deployed on the managed cluster. The console might report a status of `Degraded` until it is installed and configured. 
+
* `Gateway nodes labeled` indicates the number of gateway nodes on the managed cluster.

Submariner is now deployed on the selected clusters.
