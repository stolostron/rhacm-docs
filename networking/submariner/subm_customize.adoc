[#customizing-submariner]
= Customizing Submariner deployments

You can customize some of the settings of your Submariner deployments, including your Network Address Translation-Traversal (NATT) port, number of gateway nodes, and instance type of your gateway nodes. These customizations are consistent across all of the providers.

[#natt-port-custom]
== NATT port

If you want to customize your NATT port, customize and apply the following YAML content for your provider environment:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: submarineraddon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: SubmarinerConfig
metadata:
    name: submariner
    namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
spec:
    credentialsSecret:
      name: <managed-cluster-name>-<provider>-creds
    IPSecNATTPort: <NATTPort>
----

* Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your managed cluster.

* Replace `managed-cluster-name` with the name of your managed cluster

** AWS: Replace `provider` with `aws`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-aws-creds` is your AWS credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster.

** GCP: Replace `provider` with `gcp`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-gcp-creds` is your Google Cloud Platform credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster.

** OpenStack: Replace `provider` with `osp`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-osp-creds` is your Red Hat OpenStack Platform credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster.

** Azure: Replace `provider` with `azure`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-azure-creds` is your Microsoft Azure credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster.

* Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your managed cluster.

* Replace `managed-cluster-name` with the name of your managed cluster. The value of `managed-cluster-name-gcp-creds` is your Google Cloud Platform credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster.

* Replace `NATTPort` with the NATT port that you want to use.

*Note:* The name of the `SubmarinerConfig` must be `submariner`, as shown in the example.

[#number-gateway-nodes]
== Number of gateway nodes

If you want to customize the number of your gateway nodes, customize and apply YAML content that is similar to the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: submarineraddon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: SubmarinerConfig
metadata:
   name: submariner
   namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
spec:
   credentialsSecret:
     name: <managed-cluster-name>-<provider>-creds
  gatewayConfig:
      gateways: <gateways>
----

* Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your managed cluster.

* Replace `managed-cluster-name` with the name of your managed cluster. 

** AWS: Replace `provider` with `aws`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-aws-creds` is your AWS credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster. 

** GCP: Replace `provider` with `gcp`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-gcp-creds` is your Google Cloud Platform credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster.

** OpenStack: Replace `provider` with `osp`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-osp-creds` is your Red Hat OpenStack Platform credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster.

** Azure: Replace `provider` with `azure`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-azure-creds` is your Microsoft Azure credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster.

* Replace `gateways` with the number of gateways that you want to use. If the value is greater than 1, the Submariner gateway automatically enables high availability.

*Note:* The name of the `SubmarinerConfig` must be `submariner`, as shown in the example.

[#instance-type-gateway-nodes]
== Instance types of gateway nodes

If you want to customize the instance type of your gateway node, customize and apply YAML content that is similar to the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: submarineraddon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: SubmarinerConfig
metadata:
   name: submariner
   namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
spec:
   credentialsSecret:
     name: <managed-cluster-name>-<provider>-creds
  gatewayConfig:
      instanceType: <instance-type>
----

* Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your managed cluster.

* Replace `managed-cluster-name` with the name of your managed cluster. 

** AWS: Replace `provider` with `aws`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-aws-creds` is your AWS credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster. 

** GCP: Replace `provider` with `gcp`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-gcp-creds` is your Google Cloud Platform credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster.

** OpenStack: Replace `provider` with `osp`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-osp-creds` is your Red Hat OpenStack Platform credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster.

** Azure: Replace `provider` with `azure`. The value of `<managed-cluster-name>-azure-creds` is your Microsoft Azure credential secret name, which you can find in the cluster namespace of your hub cluster.

* Replace `instance-type` with the AWS instance type that you want to use.

*Note:* The name of the `SubmarinerConfig` must be `submariner`, as shown in the example.

[#cable-driver]
== Cable driver

The Submariner Gateway Engine component creates secure tunnels to other clusters. The cable driver component maintains the tunnels by using a pluggable architecture in the Gateway Engine component. You can use the Libreswan or VXLAN implementations for the `cableDriver` configuration of the cable engine component. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: submarineraddon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: SubmarinerConfig
metadata:
   name: submariner
   namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
spec:
   cableDriver: vxlan
   credentialsSecret:
     name: <managed-cluster-name>-<provider>-creds
   
----

*Best practice:* Do not use the VXLAN cable driver on public networks. The VXLAN cable driver is unencrypted. Only use VXLAN to avoid unnecessary double encryption on private networks. For example, some on-premise environments might handle the tunnel's encryption with a dedicated line-level hardware device.

[#using-a-customized-submariner-subscription]
== Using a customized Submariner subscription 

The Submariner add-on automatically configures a subscription for Submariner; this ensures that the version of Submariner appropriate for the installed version of {product-title-short} is installed and kept up-to-date. If you want to change this behavior, or if you want to manually control Submariner upgrades, you can customize the Submariner subscription.

When you use a customized Submariner subscription, you must complete the following fields:

- *Source:* The catalog source to use for the Submariner subscription. For example, `redhat-operators`. 
- *source Namespace:* The namespace of the catalog source. For example, `openshift-marketplace`.
- *Channel:* The channel to follow for the subscription. For example, for {product-title-short} 2.9, `stable-0.16`.
- *Starting CSV (Optional):* The initial `ClusterServiceVersion`.  
- *Install Plan Approval:* The decision to manually or automatically approve install plans. 

*Note:* If you want to manually approve the install plan, you must use a customized Submariner subscription.
