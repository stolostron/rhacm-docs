. Click the folder that matches the version of Submariner that you are using.

. Click the `tar.xz` archive for the platform that you are using to download a compressed version of the `subctl` binary.

. Extract the compressed version of the `subctl` binary to `/tmp` by running the following command. Replace `<version>` with the `subctl` version number that you are using:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc image extract registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/subctl-rhel8:v18 --path="/dist/subctl-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.xz":/tmp/ --confirm
----

. Decompress the `subctl` utility by entering the following command:

|===
| link:https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#export-service[`export service`] | Creates a `ServiceExport` resource for the specified service, which enables other clusters in the Submariner deployment to discover the corresponding service. 
| link:https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#unexport-service[`unexport service`] | Removes the `ServiceExport` resource for the specified service, which prevents other clusters in the Submariner deployment from discovering the corresponding service. 
| link:https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#show[`show`] | Provides information about Submariner resources.
| link:https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#verify[`verify`] | Verifies connectivity, service discovery, and other Submariner features when Submariner is configured across a pair of clusters.
| link:https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#benchmark[`benchmark`] | Benchmarks throughput and latency across a pair of clusters that are enabled with Submariner or within a single cluster. 
| link:https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#diagnose[`diagnose`] | Runs checks to identify issues that prevent the Submariner deployment from working correctly. 
| link:https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#gather[`gather`] | Collects information from the clusters to help troubleshoot a Submariner deployment.
| link:https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#version[`version`] | Displays the version details of the `subctl` binary tool.
