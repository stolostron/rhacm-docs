= Using ManagedClustersSets with Placement

A `Placement` resource is a namespace-scoped resource that defines a rule to select a set of `ManagedClusters` from the `ManagedClusterSets`, which are bound to the placement namespace.

**Required access**: Cluster administrator, Cluster set administrator

[#placement-overview]
== Placement overview

See the following information about how placement with managed clusters works:

- Kubernetes clusters are registered with the hub cluster as cluster-scoped `ManagedClusters`.

- The `ManagedClusters` are organized into cluster-scoped `ManagedClusterSets`.

- The `ManagedClusterSets` are bound to workload namespaces.

- The namespace-scoped `Placements` specify a portion of `ManagedClusterSets` that select a working set of the potential `ManagedClusters`.

- `Placements` select from that working set by using label and claim selectors.

+
*Important:* `Placement` does not select a `ManagedCluster` if there is no `ManagedClusterSet` bound to the placement namespace.

The `Placement' specification includes the following fields:

- `ClusterSets` represents the `ManagedClusterSets` from which the `ManagedClusters` are selected. 

  
  ** If not specified, `ManagedClusters` is selected from the `ManagedClusterSets` that are bound to the placement namespace. 

  ** If specified, `ManagedClusters` is selected from the intersection of this set and the `ManagedClusterSets` that are bound to the placement namespace.

- `NumberOfClusters` represents the desired number of `ManagedClusters` to be selected, which meet the placement requirements. 
+
If not specified, all `ManagedClusters` that meet the placement requirements are selected.

- `Predicates` represents a slice of predicates to select `ManagedClusters` with label and claim selector. The predicates are ORed.

[#placement-binding]
== Placement examples

You need to bind at least one `ManagedClusterSet` to a namespace by creating a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` in that namespace. *Note:* You need role-based access to `CREATE` on the virtual sub-resource of `managedclustersets/bind`. See the following examples:

- You can select `ManagedClusters` with the `labelSelector`. See the following sample where the `labelSelector` only matches clusters with label `vendor: OpenShift`:

- You can select `ManagedClusters` with `claimSelector`. See the following sample where `claimSelector` only matches clusters with `region.open-cluster-management.io` with `us-west-1`:

[#placement-decision]
== Placement decision

One or multiple `PlacementDecisions` with label `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement name}` are created to represent the `ManagedClusters` selected by a `Placement`.

If a `ManagedCluster` is selected and added to a `PlacementDecision`, components that consume this `Placement` might apply the workload on this `ManagedCluster`. After the `ManagedCluster` is no longer selected and it is removed from the `PlacementDecisions`, the workload that is applied on this `ManagedCluster` should be removed accordingly.

See the following `PlacementDecision` sample:
