[#scale-acm-imported]
= Provider managed clusters scaling

Imported managed clusters do not have the same resources as clusters that were created by {product-title-short}. For that reason, the procedures for scaling the clusters is different. 

See the following documentation for your provider, which contains information about how to scale the clusters for imported clusters:

* <<ocp-cluster-scale,{ocp-short} clusters>>
* <<amazon-elastic-kubernetes-services,Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services>>
* <<google-kubernetes-engine,Google Kubernetes Engine>>
* <<microsoft-azure-kubernetes-service,Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service>>
* <<vmware-vsphere,VMware vSphere>>
* <<openstack,Red Hat OpenStack Platform>>
* <<bare-metal-cluster,Bare metal cluster>>
* <<ibm-kubernetes-service,IBM Kubernetes Service>>
* <<ibm-power-systems,IBM Power systems>>
* <<ibm-z,IBM Z and LinuxONE>>
