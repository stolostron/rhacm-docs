= Creating an infrastructure environment

You can use the {product-title} console to create an infrastructure environment to manage your hosts and create clusters on those hosts.

[#infra-env-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You need the following prerequisites before creating an infrastructure environment:

* A deployed {product-title-short} hub cluster on {ocp-short} version 4.9 or later.
* Internet access for your {product-title-short} hub cluster (connected), or a connection to an internal or mirror registry that has a connection to the Internet (disconnected) to retrieve the required images for creating the environment.
* A configured instance of the Central Infrastructure Management (CIM) feature on your hub cluster.
* Your {ocp-short} https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[pull secret]. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets] for more information. 
* Your SSH key that is in your `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file, by default.

== Creating your infrastructure environment with the console

To create an infrastructure environment from the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Infrastructure environments*.
. On the _Infrastructure environments_ page, Click *Create infrastructure environment*.
. Add the following information to your infrastructure environment settings: 
+
* Name: A unique name for your environment.
* Network type: Specifies which types of hosts can be added to your environment. You can only use the static IP option when you are using bare metal hosts. 
* Location: Specifies the geographic location of the host. The geographic location can be used to easily determine where your data on a cluster is stored when you are creating the cluster. 
* Labels: Optional field where you can add labels to the infrastructure environment so you can more easily find and group the environment with other environments that share a characteristic. The selections that you made for the network type and location are automatically added to the list of labels.
* Pull secret: Your {ocp-short} https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[pull secret] that enables you to access the {ocp-short} resources. 
* SSH public key: The SSH key that enables the secure communication with the hosts. This is generally in your `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file, by default.
* If you want to enable proxy settings across all of your clusters, select the setting to enable it. This requires that you enter the following information: 
+
** HTTP Proxy URL: The URL that should be used when accessing the discovery service. 

** HTTPS Proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used when accessing the discovery service. Note that the format must be `http`, as `https` is not yet supported. 

** No Proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period (.) to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add and asterisk (*) to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

You can now continue by adding hosts to your infrastructure environment. 

[#accessing-your-infra-env]
== Accessing an infrastructure environment

To access an infrastructure environment, select *Infrastructure* > *Infrastructure environments* in the {product-title-short} console. Select your infrastructure environment from the list to view the details and hosts for that infrastructure environment.
