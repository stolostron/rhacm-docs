[#scaling-acm-created]
= Scaling managed clusters

For clusters that were created by {product-title-short}, you can customize and resize your managed cluster specifications, such as virtual machine sizes and number of nodes. 

To scale managed clusters that were imported from other providers, see link:../about/supported_providers.adoc#scale-acm-imported[Provider managed clusters scaling]
 
+
**Technology Preview:** Many clusters that are managed by {product-title} can be scaled by using {product-title-short} console or command line, and the `MachinePool` resource. 
+
- Using the `MachinePool` resource is a feature that is not supported for bare metal clusters that were created by {product-title-short}. 
+
- A `MachinePool` resource is a Kubernetes resource on the hub cluster that groups the `MachineSet` resources together on the managed cluster. 
+
- The `MachinePool` resource uniformly configures a set of machine resources, including zone configurations, instance type, and root storage. 
+
- With `MachinePool`, you can manually configure the desired number of nodes or configure auto-scaling of nodes on the managed cluster.


[#machinepools-autoscale]
== Autoscaling

Configuring autoscaling provides the flexibility of your cluster to scale as needed to lower your cost of resources by scaling down when traffic is low, and by scaling up to ensure that there are enough resources when there is a higher demand for resources. 

[#machinepools-autoscale-enable]
=== Enabling autoscaling
// This is all UI and much of it can be removed

* To enable autoscaling on your `MachinePool` resources using the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:

. In the {product-title-short} navigation, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 

. Click the name of your target cluster to view the details about the cluster.

. Select the _Machine pools_ tab to view the machine pool information.

. From the machine pools page, select *Enable autoscale* from the _Options_ menu for the target machine pool.

. Select the minimum and maximum number of machine set replicas. A machine set replica maps directly to a node on the cluster. 

. Click *Scale* to submit the changes. 
+
The changes might take several minutes to reflect on the console. You can view the status of the scaling operation by clicking *View machines* if the notification of the _Machine pools_ tab. 

//the following is the config doc, which can stay

* To enable autoscaling on your `MachinePool` resources using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Enter the following command to view your list of machine pools:
+
----
oc get machinepools -n <managed-cluster-namespace>
----
Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your target managed cluster.

. Enter the following command to edit the YAML file for the machine pool:
+
----
oc edit machinepool <name-of-MachinePool-resource> -n <namespace-of-managed-cluster>
----
Replace `name-of-MachinePool-resource` with the name of your `MachinePool` resource. 
+
Replace `namespace-of-managed-cluster` with the name of the namespace of your managed cluster.

. Delete the `spec.replicas` field from the YAML file.

. Add the `spec.autoscaling.minReplicas` setting and `spec.autoscaling.maxReplicas` fields to the resource YAML. 

. Add the minimum number of replicas to the `minReplicas` setting.

. Add the maximum number of replicas into the `maxReplicas` setting.

. Save the file to submit the changes.

Autoscaling is enabled for the machine pool.

[#machinepools-autoscale-disable]
=== Disabling autoscaling

You can disable autoscaling by using the console or the command line. 

* To disable autoscaling by using the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:
//This is UI doc and can be removed or greatly decreased

. In the {product-title-short} navigation, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 

. Click the name of your target cluster to view the details about the cluster.

. Select the _Machine pools_ tab to view the machine pool information.

. From the machine pools page, select *Disable autoscale* from the _Options_ menu for the target machine pool.

. Select the number of machine set replicas that you want. A machine set replica maps directly with a node on the cluster. 

. Click *Scale* to submit the changes. It might take several minutes to display in the console.

. Click *View machines* in the notification on the _Machine pools_ tab to view the status of the scaling.

* To disable autoscaling by using the command line, complete the following steps:
//This is config doc that can stay.

. Enter the following command to view your list of machine pools:
+
----
oc get machinepools -n <managed-cluster-namespace>
----
Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your target managed cluster.

. Enter the following command to edit the YAML file for the machine pool:
+
----
oc edit machinepool <name-of-MachinePool-resource> -n <namespace-of-managed-cluster>
----
Replace `name-of-MachinePool-resource` with the name of your `MachinePool` resource. 
+
Replace `namespace-of-managed-cluster` with the name of the namespace of your managed cluster.

. Delete the `spec.autoscaling` field from the YAML file.

. Add the `spec.replicas` field to the resource YAML. 

. Add the number of replicas to the `replicas` setting.

. Save the file to submit the changes.

Autoscaling is disabled. 

[#machinepools-scale-manual]
== Manually scaling your cluster

If you do not want to enable autoscaling of your cluster, you can use the {product-title-short} console or the command line to change the static number of replicas that you want your cluster to maintain. This can help to increase or decrease the size, as needed.

[#machinepools-scale-manual-console]
=== Manually scaling clusters by using the console

To scale your `MachinePool` resources using the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:
//Again UI

. In the {product-title-short} navigation, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 

. Click the name of your target cluster to view the details about the cluster.

. Select the _Machine pools_ tab to view the machine pool information. 
+
*Note:* If the value in the _Autoscale_ field is `Enabled` you must first disable the autoscaling feature by completing the steps in xref:machinepools-autoscale-disable[Disabling autoscaling] before continuing.

. From the _Options_ menu for the machine pool, select *Scale machine pool*. 

. Adjust the number of machine set replicas to scale the machine pool. 

. Select *Scale* to implement the change. 

[#machinepools-scale-manual-cli]
=== Manually scaling clusters by using the command line
//Again back end config (notice that this is using headers and the ones above are using bullets, considering we should have mostly backend config doc when the edits are done, we can prob go with the bullet method that is used above.)

To scale your `MachinePool` resources using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Enter the following command to view your list of machine pools:
+
----
oc get machinepools -n <managed-cluster-namespace>
----
Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your target managed cluster.

. Enter the following command to edit the YAML file for the machine pool:
+
----
oc edit machinepool <name-of-MachinePool-resource> -n <namespace-of-managed-cluster>
----
Replace `name-of-MachinePool-resource` with the name of your `MachinePool` resource. 
+
Replace `namespace-of-managed-cluster` with the name of the namespace of your managed cluster.

. Update the `spec.replicas` configuration in the YAML to the number of replicas. 

. Save the file to submit the changes. 

Your cluster is using the new size settings. 
//I would say this is a claim, and without verification, not safe to have at the end. If there is a way to confirm, great... if not, this should be removed because you cannot verify with a command.
