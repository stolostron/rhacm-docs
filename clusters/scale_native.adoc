= Scaling managed clusters created by {product-title-short}

Scaling clusters that were created by {product-title-short} using the `MachinePool` resource is a Technology Preview feature that is not supported for bare metal clusters that were created by {product-title-short}. 

[#machinepools-autoscale]
== Autoscaling

Configuring autoscaling provides the flexibility of your cluster to scale as needed to lower your cost of resources by scaling down when traffic is low, and by scaling up to ensure that there are enough resources when there is a higher demand for resources. 

[#machinepools-autoscale-enable]
=== Enabling autoscaling

* To enable autoscaling on your `MachinePool` resources using the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:

. In the {product-title-short} navigation, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 

. Click the name of your target cluster to view the details about the cluster.

. Select the _Machine pools_ tab to view the machine pool information.

. From the machine pools page, select *Enable autoscale* from the _Options_ menu for the target machine pool.

. Select the minimum and maximum number of machine set replicas. A machine set replica maps directly to a node on the cluster. 

. Click *Scale* to submit the changes. 
+
The changes might take several minutes to reflect on the console. You can view the status of the scaling operation by clicking *View machines* if the notification of the _Machine pools_ tab. 

* To enable autoscaling on your `MachinePool` resources using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Enter the following command to view your list of machine pools:
+
----
oc get machinepools -n <managed-cluster-namespace>
----
Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your target managed cluster.

. Enter the following command to edit the YAML file for the machine pool:
+
----
oc edit machinepool <name-of-MachinePool-resource> -n <namespace-of-managed-cluster>
----
Replace `name-of-MachinePool-resource` with the name of your `MachinePool` resource. 
+
Replace `namespace-of-managed-cluster` with the name of the namespace of your managed cluster.

. Delete the `spec.replicas` field from the YAML file.

. Add the `spec.autoscaling.minReplicas` setting and `spec.autoscaling.maxReplicas` fields to the resource YAML. 

. Add the minimum number of replicas to the `minReplicas` setting.

. Add the maximum number of replicas into the `maxReplicas` setting.

. Save the file to submit the changes.

Autoscaling is enabled for the machine pool.

[#machinepools-autoscale-disable]
=== Disabling autoscaling

You can disable autoscaling by using the console or the command line. 

* To disable autoscaling by using the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:

. In the {product-title-short} navigation, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 

. Click the name of your target cluster to view the details about the cluster.

. Select the _Machine pools_ tab to view the machine pool information.

. From the machine pools page, select *Disable autoscale* from the _Options_ menu for the target machine pool.

. Select the number of machine set replicas that you want. A machine set replica maps directly with a node on the cluster. 

. Click *Scale* to submit the changes. It might take several minutes to display in the console.

. Click *View machines* in the notification on the _Machine pools_ tab to view the status of the scaling.

* To disable autoscaling by using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Enter the following command to view your list of machine pools:
+
----
oc get machinepools -n <managed-cluster-namespace>
----
Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your target managed cluster.

. Enter the following command to edit the YAML file for the machine pool:
+
----
oc edit machinepool <name-of-MachinePool-resource> -n <namespace-of-managed-cluster>
----
Replace `name-of-MachinePool-resource` with the name of your `MachinePool` resource. 
+
Replace `namespace-of-managed-cluster` with the name of the namespace of your managed cluster.

. Delete the `spec.autoscaling` field from the YAML file.

. Add the `spec.replicas` field to the resource YAML. 

. Add the number of replicas to the `replicas` setting.

. Save the file to submit the changes.

Autoscaling is disabled. 

[#machinepools-scale-manual]
== Manually scaling your cluster

If you do not want to enable autoscaling of your cluster, you can use the {product-title-short} console or the command line to change the static number of replicas that you want your cluster to maintain. This can help to increase or decrease the size, as needed.

[#machinepools-scale-manual-console]
=== Manually scaling clusters by using the console

To scale your `MachinePool` resources using the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:

. In the {product-title-short} navigation, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 

. Click the name of your target cluster to view the details about the cluster.

. Select the _Machine pools_ tab to view the machine pool information. 
+
*Note:* If the value in the _Autoscale_ field is `Enabled` you must first disable the autoscaling feature by completing the steps in xref:machinepools-autoscale-disable[Disabling autoscaling] before continuing.

. From the _Options_ menu for the machine pool, select *Scale machine pool*. 

. Adjust the number of machine set replicas to scale the machine pool. 

. Select *Scale* to implement the change. 

[#machinepools-scale-manual-cli]
=== Manually scaling clusters by using the command line

To scale your `MachinePool` resources using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Enter the following command to view your list of machine pools:
+
----
oc get machinepools -n <managed-cluster-namespace>
----
Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your target managed cluster.

. Enter the following command to edit the YAML file for the machine pool:
+
----
oc edit machinepool <name-of-MachinePool-resource> -n <namespace-of-managed-cluster>
----
Replace `name-of-MachinePool-resource` with the name of your `MachinePool` resource. 
+
Replace `namespace-of-managed-cluster` with the name of the namespace of your managed cluster.

. Update the `spec.replicas` configuration in the YAML to the number of replicas. 

. Save the file to submit the changes. 

Your cluster is using the new size settings.
