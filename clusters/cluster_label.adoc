= Managing cluster labels

Add a label to your cluster to select group resources.
See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/[Labels and Selectors] for more information.

You can add new labels, remove existing labels, and edit existing labels for your clusters.
Complete the following steps to manage your labels:

. From the navigation menu, click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. Find your cluster in the _Clusters_ table.
. Click *Options* to see the options in the menu.
. Select *Edit labels*.
. In the _Edit labels_ dialog box, enter a label. Your entry might resemble the following content: `Key=Value`. 
. Press `enter`, add a comma, or add a space to add additional labels.
. Click *Save* when you enter your last one. Labels are only saved after you click *Save*. 
. Close the Edit labels pane, when you are finished.

* If you want to remove an existing label, click the *Remove* icon for the label that you want to remove in the list.
* If you want to update an existing label, you can reassign its key to a new value by adding a new label using the same key with a different value. For example, you can change `Key=Value` by entering `Key=NewValue` to update the value of `Key`.

*Tip*: You can also edit a cluster label from the cluster details page. In the navigation menu, click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 
From the Clusters page, access the details page for the cluster by clicking the name of the cluster. Select the *Edit* icon in the _Labels_ section. The _Edit labels_ dialog box is displayed.
