= Destroying a cluster pool

If you created a cluster pool and determine that you no longer need it, you can destroy the cluster pool. When you destroy a cluster pool, all of the unclaimed hibernating clusters are destroyed and their resources are released.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

To destroy a cluster pool, complete the following steps: 

. From the navigation menu, click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the _Cluster pools_ tab.

. Find the name of the cluster pool in the _Cluster pools_ table.

. Click the _Options_ menu to view the options for the cluster pool.

. Select *Destroy cluster pool*.

. Enter the name of the cluster pool to confirm.

. Select *Destroy* to remove the cluster pool. The clusters in the destroyed cluster pool are removed from the console while they are destroyed. It might take some time for all of the resources to be deleted after the clusters are removed from the console.

When you destroy a cluster pool, you must manually delete its secrets. If you do not delete the secrets, creating a cluster pool with the same name and namespace fails because the new secrets collide with the existing secrets. 

*Tip:* You can destroy multiple cluster pools with one action by selecting the box for each of the the cluster pools and using the _Actions_ menu to destroy the selected cluster pools.

Your cluster pool is deleted.
