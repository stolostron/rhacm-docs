[#prereq-backup-restore-enable]
== Prerequisites

*For both active and passive hub clusters*:

** From your {ocp} cluster, install the {product-title} operator version {product-version}.x. The `MultiClusterHub` resource is automatically created when you install {product-title-short}, and displays the following status: `Running`.

** The cluster backup and restore operator must be installed manually. Enable the cluster backup and restore operator (`cluster-backup`). Edit the `MultiClusterHub` resource by setting the `cluster-backup` parameter to `true`. This installs the OADP operator in the same namespace with the `cluster-backup` resource.

*For passive hub clusters*:

** Before you run the restore operation on the passive hub cluster, you must manually configure the hub cluster and install all operators on the active hub cluster, and in the same namespace as the active hub cluster.

** Ensure that the {product-title-short} operator is installed in the same namespace as the initial hub cluster. Then create the `DataProtectionApplication` resource and connect to the same storage location where the initial hub cluster backed up data. View the following `DataProtectionApplication` resource sample:
+

          bucket: my-bucket
          prefix: my-prefix
        config:
          region: us-east-1
          profile: "default"
        credential:
          name: cloud-credentials
          key: cloud
  snapshotLocations:
    - name: default
      velero:
        provider: aws
        config:
          region: us-west-2
          profile: "default"
----

** Before you run the restore operation, verify that other operators, such as Ansible Automation Platform, {ocp} GitOps, or certificate manager are installed. This ensures that the new hub cluster is configured the same way as the initial hub cluster.

** The passive hub cluster must use the same namespace names as the initial hub cluster when you install the backup and restore operator, and any other operators that are configured on the previous hub cluster. 


[#enabling-backup-restore]
== Enabling the backup and restore operator

The cluster backup and restore operator can be enabled when the `MultiClusterHub` resource is created for the first time. The `cluster-backup` parameter is set to `true`. When the operator is enabled, the operator resources are installed.

If the `MultiClusterHub` resource is already created, you can install or uninstall the cluster backup operator by editing the `MultiClusterHub` resource. Set `cluster-backup` to `false`, if you want to uninstall the cluster backup operator.

When the backup and restore operator is enabled, your `MultiClusterHub` resource might resemble the following YAML file:

[source,yaml]

apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1

[#using-backup-restore]
== Using the backup and restore operator

Complete the following steps to schedule and restore backups:

. Use the backup and restore operator, `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` and `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resources, to create a `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource using the `cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml` sample file. See the link:https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-backup-operator/tree/release-2.5/config/samples[`cluster-backup-operator` samples]. Run the following command to create a `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource using the `cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml` sample file:
+
----
kubectl create -n <oadp-operator-ns> -f config/samples/cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml
----
+
Your resource might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: schedule-acm
spec:
  veleroSchedule: 0 */6 * * * # Create a backup every 6 hours
  veleroTtl: 72h # deletes scheduled backups after 72h; optional, if not specified, the maximum default value set by velero is used - 720h
----
+
View the following descriptions of the `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` `spec` properties:
+
** `veleroSchedule` is a required property and defines a cron job for scheduling the backups.
** `veleroTtl` is an optional property and defines the expiration time for a scheduled backup resource. If not specified, the maximum default value set by Velero is used, which is `720h`.

. Check the status of your `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, which displays the definition for the three `schedule.velero.io` resources. Run the following command:
+
----
oc get bsch -n <oadp-operator-ns>
----

. As a reminder, the restore operation is run on a different hub cluster for restore scenarios. To initiate a restore operation, create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource on the hub cluster where you want to restore backups.
+
**Note:** When you restore a backup on a new hub cluster, make sure that the previous hub cluster, where the backup was created, is shut down. If it is running, the previous hub cluster tries to reimport the managed clusters as soon as the managed cluster reconciliation finds that the managed clusters are no longer available.
+
You can use the cluster backup and restore operator, `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` and `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resources, to create a backup or restore resource. See the link:https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-backup-operator/tree/release-2.5/config/samples[`cluster-backup-operator` samples].
. Run the following command to create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource using the `cluster_v1beta1_restore.yaml` sample file. Be sure to replace the `oadp-operator-ns` with the namespace name used to install the OADP Operator. The default value for the OADP Operator install namespace is `oadp-operator`:
+
----
kubectl create -n <oadp-operator-ns> -f config/samples/cluster_v1beta1_restore.yaml
----
+
Your resource might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupName: latest
----
+
View the following description of the three required `spec` properties for `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`:
+
** `veleroManagedClustersBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the managed cluster activiation data.
** `veleroCredentialsBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the user credentials.
** `veleroResourcesBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the hub cluster resources (`Applications`, `Policy`, and other hub resources like managged cluster passive data).
+
The valid options for the previously mentioned properties are following values:
+
** `latest` - This property restores the last available backup file for this type of backup.
** `skip` - This property does not attempt to restore this type of backup with the current restore operation.
** `backup_name` - This property restores the specified backup by referencing the name.

. View the Velero `Restore` resource by running the following command:
+
----
oc get restore.velero.io -n <oadp-operator-ns>
----
+
View the following YAML examples to restore different types of backed up files:
+
** Restore all three types of backed up resources:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupSchedule: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupSchedule: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupSchedule: latest
----
+
** Restore only managed cluster resources:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: skip
  veleroResourcesBackupName: skip
----
+
** Restore the resources for managed clusters only, using the `acm-managed-clusters-schedule-20210902205438` backup:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: acm-managed-clusters-schedule-20210902205438
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: skip
  veleroResourcesBackupName: skip
----
+
*Notes*: 
+
* The `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource is run once. After the restore operation is completed, you can optionally run another restore operation on the same hub cluster. You must create a new `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource to run a new restore operation.
+
* You can create multiple `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, however only one can be run at any moment.
