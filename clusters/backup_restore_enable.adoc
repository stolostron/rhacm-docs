[#prereq-backup-restore-enable]
== Prerequisites

*For both active and passive hub clusters*:

** You must install {product-title-short} version {product-version}.x. The `MultiClusterHub` resource is automatically created when you install {product-title-short}, and displays the following status: `Running`.

** Enable the cluster backup and restore operator (`cluster-backup`). Edit the `MultiClusterHub` resource by setting the `cluster-backup` parameter to `true`. This installs the OADP operator in the same namespace with the `cluster-backup` resource.

*For passive hub clusters*:

** Before you run the restore operation on the passive hub cluster, you must manually configure the hub cluster and install all operators on the active hub cluster in the same namespace as the active hub cluster.

** Ensure that the {product-title-short} bakup and restore operator is installed in the same namespace as the initial hub cluster. Then create the `DataProtectionApplication` resource and connect to the same storage location where the initial hub cluster backed up data. View the following `DataProtectionApplication` resource sample:

          profile: "default"
----

** Before you run the restore operatoin, verify that other operators, such as Ansible Automation Platform, {ocp} GitOps, or certificate manager are installed. This ensures that the new hub cluster is configured in the same namespace as the initial hub cluster.

** The passive hub cluster must use the same namespace as the initial hub cluster when you install the backup and restore operator, and any other operators that are configured on the previous hub cluster. 


[#enabling-backup-restore]
== Enabling the backup and restore operator

The cluster backup and restore operator can be enabled when the `MultiClusterHub` resource is created for the first time. From the {ocp-short} console, select the *Enable Cluster Backup switch* to enable the operator. The `enableClusterBackup` parameter is set to `true`. When the operator is enabled, the operator resources are installed.

If the `MultiClusterHub` resource is already created, you can install or uninstall the cluster backup operator by editing the `MultiClusterHub` resource. Set `enableClusterBackup` to `false`, if you want to uninstall the cluster backup operator.

When the backup and restore operator is enabled, your `MultiClusterHub` resource might resemble the following YAML file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
  kind: MultiClusterHub
  metadata:
    name: multiclusterhub
    namespace: open-cluster-management

[#using-backup-restore]
== Using the backup and restore operator

Complete the following steps to schedule and restore backups:

. Use the backup and restore operator, `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` and `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resources, to create a `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource using the `cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml` sample file. See the link:https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-backup-operator/tree/main/config/samples[`cluster-backup-operator` samples]. Run the following command to create a `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource using the `cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml` sample file:
+
----
kubectl create -n <oadp-operator-ns> -f config/samples/cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml
----
+
Your resource might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: schedule-acm
spec:
  veleroSchedule: 0 */6 * * * # Create a backup every 6 hours
  veleroTtl: 72h # deletes scheduled backups after 72h; optional, if not specified, the maximum default value set by velero is used - 720h
----
+
View the following descriptions of the `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` `spec` properties:
+
** `veleroSchedule` is a required property and defines a cron job for scheduling the backups.
** `veleroTtl` is an optional property and defines the expiration time for a scheduled backup resource. If not specified, the maximum default value set by Velero is used, which is `720h`.

. Check the status of your `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, which displays the definition for the three `schedule.velero.io` resources. Run the following command:
+
----
oc get bsch -n <oadp-operator-ns>
----

. As a reminder, the restore operation is run on a different hub cluster for restore scenarios. To initiate a restore operation, create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource on the hub cluster where you want to restore backups.
+
You can use the cluster backup and restore operator, `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` and `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resources, to create a backup or restore resource. See the link:https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-backup-operator/tree/main/config/samples[`cluster-backup-operator` samples].
. Run the following command to create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource using the `cluster_v1beta1_restore.yaml` sample file. Be sure to replace the `oadp-operator-ns` with the namespace name used to install the OADP Operator. The default value for the OADP Operator install namespace is `oadp-operator`:
+
----
kubectl create -n <oadp-operator-ns> -f config/samples/cluster_v1beta1_restore.yaml
----
+
Your resource might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupName: latest
----
+
View the following description of the three required `spec` properties for `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`:
+
** `veleroManagedClustersBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the managed clusters.
** `veleroCredentialsBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the user credentials.
** `veleroResourcesBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the hub cluster resources (`Applications` and `Policy`).
+
The valid options for the previously mentioned properties are following values:
+
** `latest` - This property restores the last available backup file for this type of backup.
** `skip` - This property does not attempt to restore this type of backup with the current restore operation.
** `backup_name` - This property restores the specified backup by referencing the name.

. View the Velero `Restore` resource by running the following command:
+
----
oc get restore.velero.io -n <oadp-operator-ns>
----
+
View the following YAML examples to restore different types of backed up files:
+
** Restore all three types of backed up resources:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupSchedule: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupSchedule: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupSchedule: latest
----
+
** Restore only managed cluster resources:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: skip
  veleroResourcesBackupName: skip
----
+
** Restore the resources for managed clusters only, using the `acm-managed-clusters-schedule-20210902205438` backup:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: acm-managed-clusters-schedule-20210902205438
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: skip
  veleroResourcesBackupName: skip
----

*Notes*: 

* The `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource is run once. After the restore operation is completed, you can optionally run another restore operation on the same hub cluster. You must create a new `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource to run a new restore operation.

* You can create multiple `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, however only one can be run at any moment.


[#scheduling-a-cluster-backup]
=== Scheduling a cluster backup

A backup schedule is activated when you create the `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource. View the following `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` sample:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: schedule-acm
spec:
  veleroSchedule: 0 */2 * * *
  veleroTtl: 120h
----

After you create a `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, run the following command to get the status of the scheduled cluster backups:

----
oc get bsch -n <oadp-operator-ns>
----

The `<oadp-operator-ns>` parameter in the previous command is the namespace where the `BackupSchedule` ia created, which is the same namespace where the OADP Operator is installed. The `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource creates six `schedule.velero.io` resources, which are used to generate backups. Run the following command to view the list of the backups that are scheduled:

----
os get schedules -A | grep acm
----

Resources are separately backed up in the following groups:

* _Credential backup_, which contains three backup files for Hive, {product-title-short}, and generic backups.
* _Resource backup_, which contains one backup for the {product-title-short} resources and one for generic resources. These resources use the following label, `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup`.
* _Managed clusters backup_, which contains only resources that activte the managed cluster connection to the hub cluster, where the backup is restored. The scheduled backup uses the following label, `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup-schedule-type: acm-managed-clusters`.

*Notes*: 

* The _resource backup_ file contains managed cluster-specific resources, but does not contain the subset of resources that connect managed clusters to the hub cluster. The resources that connect managed clusters are also called activation resources and are contained in the managed clusters backup. When you restore backups only for the _credentials_ and _resource_ backup on a new hub cluser, the new hub cluster shows all managed clusters in a detatched state. The managed clusters are still connected to the original hub cluster that created the backup files.

* Only created managed clusters that use the Hive API are automatically connected with the new hub cluster when the `acm-managed-clusters` backup, from the _managed clusters_ backup is restored on another hub cluster. All other managed clusters are in the `Pending Import` state and must be imported back onto the new hub cluster.

* When you restore the `acm-managed-clusters` backup on a new hub cluster by using the `veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest` option in the restore resource, verify that the backups from the previous hub cluster is shut down. Otherwise, the previous hub cluster attempts to reconnect with the managed cluster, immediately after the managed cluster reconciliation add-ons find that the mangaed clusters are no longer available. If this occurs, both hub clusters attempt to manage clusters at the same time. 


See xref:../clusters/backup_and_restore.adoc#restore-backup[Restore a backup] for a description of the required specification properties and the valid options.
