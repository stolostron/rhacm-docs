[#backup-restore-enable]
= Enable the backup and restore operator (Technology Preview)

Enable the cluster backup and restore operator to schedule back up and restore for your cluster resources. {product-title} offers the cluster backup operator as a Technology Preview that is disabled by default.

**Required access**: Cluster administrator 

[#prereq-backup-restore-enable]
== Prerequisites

You must install the 0.4.2 version of the OADP Operator from the _beta_ channel. See the link:https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator/blob/oadp-0.4.2/docs/install_olm.md[Install OADP Operator using OperatorHub] documentation.

*Note*: Be sure to follow the OADP Operator installation instructions to create the Velero resource, and to create a valid connection to a backup storage location, where the backups are stored. View the link:https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator/blob/oadp-0.4.2/docs/install_olm.md[Installation and setup steps] from the `oadp-operator` repository.

[#enabling-backup-restore]
== Enabling the backup and restore operator

The cluster backup and restore operator can be enabled when the `MultiClusterHub` resource is created for the first time. From the {ocp-short} console, select the *Enable Cluster Backup switch* to enable the operator. The `enableClusterBackup` parameter is set to `true`. When the operator is enabled, the operator resources are installed.

If the `MultiClusterHub` resource is already created, you can install or uninstall the cluster backup operator by editing the `MultiClusterHub` resource. Set `enableClusterBackup` to `false`, if you want to uninstall the cluster backup operator.

When the backup and restore operator is enabled, your `MultiClusterHub` resource might resemble the following YAML file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
  kind: MultiClusterHub
  metadata:
    name: multiclusterhub
    namespace: open-cluster-management
  spec:
    availabilityConfig: High
    enableClusterBackup: true <-----
    imagePullSecret: multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret

[#using-backup-restore]
== Using the backup and restore operator

Complete the following steps to schedule and restore backups:

. Use the backup and restore operator, `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` and `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resources, to create a `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource using the `cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml` sample file. See the link:https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-backup-operator/tree/main/config/samples[`cluster-backup-operator` samples]. Run the following command to create a `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource using the `cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml` sample file:
+
----
kubectl create -n <oadp-operator-ns> -f config/samples/cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml
----
+
Your resource might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: schedule-acm
spec:
  maxBackups: 10 # maximum number of backups after which old backups should be removed
  veleroSchedule: 0 */6 * * * # Create a backup every 6 hours
  veleroTtl: 72h # deletes scheduled backups after 72h; optional, if not specified, the maximum default value set by velero is used - 720h
----
+
View the following descriptions of the `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` `spec` properties:
+
** `maxBackup` is a required property and represents the maximum number of backups after previous backups are removed.
** `veleroSchedule` is a required property and defines a cron job for scheduling the backups.
** `veleroTtl` is an optional property and defines the expiration time for a scheduled backup resource. If not specified, the maximum default value set by Velero is used, which is `720h`.

. Check the status of your `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, which displays the definition for the three `schedule.velero.io` resources. Run the following command:
+
----
oc get bsch -n <oadp-operator-ns>
----

. As a reminder, the restore operation is run on a different hub cluster for restore scenarios. To initiate a restore operation, create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource on the hub cluster where you want to restore backups.
+
You can use the cluster backup and restore operator, `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` and `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resources, to create a backup or restore resource. See the link:https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-backup-operator/tree/main/config/samples[`cluster-backup-operator` samples].
. Run the following command to create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource using the `cluster_v1beta1_restore.yaml` sample file. Be sure to replace the `oadp-operator-ns` with the namespace name used to install the OADP Operator. The default value for the OADP Operator install namespace is `oadp-operator`:
+
----
kubectl create -n <oadp-operator-ns> -f config/samples/cluster_v1beta1_restore.yaml
----
+
Your resource might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupName: latest
----
+
View the following description of the three required `spec` properties for `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`:
+
** `veleroManagedClustersBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the managed clusters.
** `veleroCredentialsBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the user credentials.
** `veleroResourcesBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the hub cluster resources (`Applications` and `Policy`).
+
The valid options for the previously mentioned properties are following values:
+
** `latest` - This property restores the last available backup file for this type of backup.
** `skip` - This property does not attempt to restore this type of backup with the current restore operation.
** `backup_name` - This property restores the specified backup by referencing the name.

. View the Velero `Restore` resource by running the following command:
+
----
oc get restore.velero.io -n <oadp-operator-ns>
----
+
View the following YAML examples to restore different types of backed up files:
+
** Restore all three types of backed up resources:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupSchedule: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupSchedule: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupSchedule: latest
----
+
** Restore only managed cluster resources:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: skip
  veleroResourcesBackupName: skip
----
+
** Restore the resources for managed clusters only, using the `acm-managed-clusters-schedule-20210902205438` backup:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: acm-managed-clusters-schedule-20210902205438
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: skip
  veleroResourcesBackupName: skip
----

See xref:../clusters/backup_and_restore.adoc#restore-backup[Restore a backup] for a description of the required specification properties and the valid options. *Note*: The `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource is run once. After the restore operation is completed, you can optionally run another restore operation on the same hub cluster. You must create a new `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource to run a new restore operation.
