= Installing and upgrading {mce-short}

The {mce-short} is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports{ocp} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. 

*Deprecated:* {mce-short} 2.2 and earlier versions are no longer supported. The documentation might remain available, but without any Errata or other updates.

*Best practice:* Upgrade to the most recent version.

The documentation references the earliest supported {ocp-short} version, unless a specific component or function is introduced and tested only on a more recent version of {ocp-short}.

For full support information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7073030[Support matrix]. For life cycle information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{ocp} Life Cycle policy].

*Important:* If you are using {acm-short} version 2.5 or later, then {mce} is already installed on the cluster.
