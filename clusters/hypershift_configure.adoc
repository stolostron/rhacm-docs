[#hypershift-configure]
= Configuring hosted control planes

You can deploy hosted control planes by converting an existing cluster to a hosting service cluster and then deploying a cluster that is managed by the HyperShift hosting service cluster that you converted. 

*Important:* Because hosted control planes is a Technology Preview feature, the related components are disabled by default. Enable the feature by editing the `multiclusterengine` custom resource to set the `spec.overrides.components[?(@.name=='hypershift-preview')].enabled` to `true`. 

Enter the following command to verify that the hosted control planes feature is enabled:

----
oc get mce multiclusterengine-sample -ojsonpath="{.spec.overrides.components[?(@.name=='hypershift-preview')].enabled}"
true
----

[#hypershift-convert-mgt-cluster]
== Converting an existing cluster to a hosting service cluster

[#hypershift-convert-mgt-cluster-prereq]
=== Prerequisites

You must have the multicluster engine operator installed on at least one cluster that is managed by {ocp}. The multicluster engine operator is automatically installed when you install {product-title-short} version 2.5, and later.

*Note:* If you want your {product-title-short} hub cluster to be your hosted control planes hosting service cluster, you can configure `local-cluster` as your hosting service cluster. A hub cluster that is also managed by itself is designated as `local-cluster` in the list of clusters. 

Complete the following steps to convert an {ocp-short} managed cluster to a hosting service cluster:

. Install the HyperShift add-on.
+
The cluster that hosts the HyperShift operator is the hosting service cluster. This step uses the `hypershift-addon` to install the HyperShift operator on a managed cluster.
+
.. Create the `ManagedClusterAddon` HyperShift add-on by creating a file that resembles the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  name: hypershift-addon
  namespace: <hypershift-hosting-service-cluster> 
spec:
  installNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----
+
Replace `hypershift-hosting-service-cluster` with the name of the managed cluster on which you want to install the HyperShift operator.

.. Apply the file by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f <filename>
----
+
Replace `filename` with the name of the file that you created. 

. Create an OIDC s3 credentials secret file named `hypershift-operator-oidc-provider-s3-credentials` for the HyperShift operator. Create the secret in the same namespace where your `hypershift-hosting-service-cluster` is hosted. 
+
The secret must contain 3 fields:
+
* `bucket`: An S3 bucket with public access to host OIDC discovery documents for your HyperShift clusters
* `credentials`: A reference to a file than contains the credentials of the `default` profile that can access the bucket. By default, HyperShift only uses the `default` profile to operate the `bucket`.
* `region`: Region of the s3 bucket

+
See https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/getting-started/[Getting started] in the HyperShift documentation for more information about the secret. The following example shows a sample Amazon Web services secret template:
+
----
oc create secret generic hypershift-operator-oidc-provider-s3-credentials --from-file=credentials=$HOME/.aws/credentials --from-literal=bucket=<s3-bucket-for-hypershift> 
--from-literal=region=<region> -n <hypershift-hosting-service-cluster>
----

+
*Note:* Disaster recovery backup for the secret is not automatically enabled. Run the following command to add the label that enables the `hypershift-operator-oidc-provider-s3-credentials` secret to be backed up for disaster recovery:

----
oc label secret hypershift-operator-oidc-provider-s3-credentials -n <hypershift-hosting-service-cluster> cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup=""
----

. Confirm that the `hypershift-addon` is installed by running the following command:
+
----
oc get managedclusteraddons -n <hypershift-hosting-service-cluster> hypershift-addon
----
+
The output resembles the following example, when the add-on is installed:
+
----
NAME               AVAILABLE   DEGRADED   PROGRESSING
hypershift-addon   True
----

Your HyperShift add-on is installed and the hosting service cluster is available to managed HyperShift clusters.

[#hypershift-deploy-cluster]
== Deploying a HyperShift managed cluster

After installing the HyperShift operator and converting an existing cluster into a hosting service cluster, you can provision a HyperShift hosted cluster by creating a `HypershiftDeployment` custom resource. 

. Create a cloud provider secret as a credential using the console or a file addition. You must have permissions to create infrastructure resources for your cluster, like VPCs, subnets, and NAT gateways,. The account also must correspond to the account for your guest cluster, where your workers live. See https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/how-to/aws/create-infra-iam-separately/[Create AWS infrastructure and IAM resources separately] in the HyperShift documentation for more information about the required permissions.
+
The following example shows the format for Amazon Web Services:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-aws-cred
  namespace: default      # Where you create HypershiftDeployment resources
type: Opaque
kind: Secret
stringData:
  ssh-publickey:          # Value
  ssh-privatekey:         # Value
  pullSecret:             # Value, required
  baseDomain:             # Value, required
  aws_secret_access_key:  # Value, required
  aws_access_key_id:      # Value, required
----
+
* To create this secret with the console, follow the credential creation steps by accessing *Credentials* in the navigation menu. 
+
* To create the secret using the command line, run the following commands:
+
----
oc create secret generic <my-secret> -n <hypershift-deployment-namespace> --from-literal=baseDomain='your.domain.com' --from-literal=aws_access_key_id='your-aws-access-key' --from-literal=aws_secret_access_key='your-aws-secret-key' --from-literal=pullSecret='{"auths":{"cloud.openshift.com":{"auth":"auth-info", "email":"xx@redhat.com"}, "quay.io":{"auth":"auth-info", "email":"xx@redhat.com"} } }' --from-literal=ssh-publickey='your-ssh-publickey' --from-literal=ssh-privatekey='your-ssh-privatekey'
----
+
*Note:* Disaster recovery backup for the secret is not automatically enabled. Run the following command to add a label that enables the secret to be backed up for disaster recovery:
----
oc label secret <my-secret> -n <hypershift-deployment-namespace> cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup=""
----

. Create a `HypershiftDeployment` custom resource file in the cloud provider secret namespace. The `HypershiftDeployment` custom resource creates the infrastructure in the provider account, configures the infrastructure compute capacity in the created infrastructure, provisions the `nodePools` that use the hosted control plane, and creates a hosted control plane on a hosting service cluster.
+
.. Create a file that contains information that resembles the following example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1

Replace `cluster` with the name of the cluster. 
+
Replace `hosting-service-cluster` with the name of the cluster that hosts the HyperShift operator. 
+
Replace `my-secret` with the secret to access your cloud provider. 
+ 
Replace `region` with the region of your cloud provider.

.. Apply the file by entering the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f <filename>
----
+
You can refer to the https://github.com/stolostron/hypershift-deployment-controller/blob/main/api/v1alpha1/hypershiftdeployment_types.go[field definitions] of the API to ensure that they are correct.

. Check the `HypershiftDeployment` status by running the following command:
+
----
oc get hypershiftdeployment -n default hypershift-demo -w
----

. After the hosted cluster is created, it is automatically imported to the hub. You can verify this by viewing the cluster list in the {product-title-short} console, or by running the following command: 
+
----
oc get managedcluster <hypershiftDeployment.Spec.infraID>
----

Your managed cluster is created. Continue with xref:../clusters/hypershift_access.adoc#hypershift-access[Accessing a Hosting Service Cluster].
