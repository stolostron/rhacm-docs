= Maintaining a custom list of release images while disconnected

In some cases, you need to maintain a custom list of release images when the hub cluster has no Internet connection.
You can create your own custom list of release images that are available when creating a cluster.
Complete the following steps to manage your available release images while disconnected:

. While you are on a connected system, navigate to the https://github.com/stolostron/acm-hive-openshift-releases/tree/release-2.3[acm-hive-openshift-releases GitHub repository] with the cluster image sets that are available for version 2.3.

. Copy the `clusterImageSets` directory to a system that can access the disconnected {product-title} hub cluster.

. Add the YAML files for the images that you want available when you create a cluster by using the {product-title-short} console by manually adding the `clusterImageSet` YAML content.

. Modify the `clusterImageSet` YAML files for the remaining {ocp-short} release images to reference the correct offline repository where you store the images. Your updates should resemble the following example: 
+
----
apiVersion: hive.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterImageSet
metadata:
    name: img4.4.0-rc.6-x86-64
spec:
    releaseImage: IMAGE_REGISTRY_IPADDRESS_or_DNSNAME/REPO_PATH/ocp-release:4.4.0-rc.6-x86_64
----
+
Ensure that the images are loaded in the offline image registry that is referenced in the YAML file.

. Create each of the `clusterImageSets` by entering the following command for each YAML file:
+
----
oc create -f <clusterImageSet_FILE>
----
+
Replace `clusterImageSet_FILE` with the name of the cluster image set file. For example:
+
----
oc create -f img4.9.9-x86_64.yaml
----
+
After running this command for each resource you want to add, the list of available release images will be available.

. Alternately you can paste the image URL directly in the create cluster console in {product-title-short}. Adding the image URL creates new clusterImageSets if they do not exist.

. View the list of currently available release images in the {product-title-short} console when you are creating a cluster.
