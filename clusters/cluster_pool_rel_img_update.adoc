= Updating the cluster pool release image

*Required access*: Edit

Complete the following steps to update the {ocp-short} release image for the clusters in your cluster pool:

*Note:* This procedure does not update clusters from the cluster pool that are already claimed or hibernating in the cluster pool. After you complete this procedure. only clusters that are created and added to the cluster pool use the updated release image.
