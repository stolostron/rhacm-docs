= Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets (Technology Preview)

// add prereq for users to managed cluster and managed cluster set 

A `ManagedClusterSet` is a group of managed clusters. With a managed cluster set, you can manage access to all of the managed clusters in the group together. You can also create a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource to bind a `ManagedClusterSet` resource to a namespace.

[#creating-a-managedclusterset]
== Creating a ManagedClusterSet

You can group managed clusters together in a managed cluster set to limit the user access on managed clusters.  

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

A `ManagedClusterSet` is a cluster-scoped resource, so you must have cluster administration permissions for the cluster where you are creating the `ManagedClusterSet`. A managed cluster cannot be included in more than one `ManagedClusterSet`. You can create a managed cluster set from either the {product-title} console or from the command-line interface.

[#creating-a-managedclusterset-console]
=== Creating a _ManagedClusterSet_ by using the console

Complete the following steps to create a managed cluster set by using the {product-title-short} console:
 
. In the main console navigation, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the _Cluster sets_ tab.

. Select *Create cluster set*.

. Enter the name of the cluster set that you want to create.

. Select *Create* to create the cluster set resource.

[#creating-a-managedclusterset-cli]
=== Creating a _ManagedClusterSet_ by using the command line

Add the following definition of the managed cluster set to your `yaml` file to create a managed cluster set by using the command line:

----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterSet
metadata:
  name: <clusterset1>
----

Replace `clusterset1` with the name of your managed cluster set. 

[#adding-clusters-to-a-managedclusterset]
== Adding clusters to a _ManagedClusterSet_
//possibly part of scenario 2, but still need to add info about creating a cluster

After you create your `ManagedClusterSet`, you must add one or more managed clusters. You can add managed clusters to your managed cluster set by using either the console or the command line.

[#adding-clusters-to-a-managedclusterset-console]
=== Adding clusters to a _ManagedClusterSet_ by using the console

Complete the following steps to add a cluster to a managed cluster set by using the {product-title-short} console:

. If you just created your managed cluster set, select *Manage resource assignments* to go directly to the _Manage resource assignments_ page. Continue with step 6 of this procedure. 

. If your cluster already exists, access the cluster page by selecting *Infrastructure* > *Clusters* in the main navigation.

. Select the *Cluster sets* tab to view the available cluster sets. 

. Select the name of the cluster set that you want to add to the managed cluster sets to view the cluster set details.

. Select *Actions* > *Manage resource assignments*.

. On the _Manage resource assignments_ page, select the checkbox for the resources that you want to add to the cluster set. 

. Select *Review* to review your changes. 

. Select *Save* to save your changes. 
+
*Note:* If you move a managed cluster from one managed cluster set to another, you must have the required RBAC permission available on both managed cluster sets.  

[#adding-clusters-to-a-managedclusterset-cli]
=== Adding clusters to a _ManagedClusterSet_ by using the command line

Complete the following steps to add a cluster to a managed cluster set by using the command line:

. Ensure that there is an RBAC `ClusterRole` entry that allows you to create on a virtual subresource of `managedclustersets/join`. Without this permission, you cannot assign a managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`. 
+
If this entry does not exist, add it to your `yaml` file. A sample entry resembles the following content:
+
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: clusterrole1
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["cluster.open-cluster-management.io"]
    resources: ["managedclustersets/join"]
    resourceNames: ["<clusterset1>"]
    verbs: ["create"]
----
+
Replace `clusterset1` with the name of your `ManagedClusterSet`.
+
*Note:* If you are moving a managed cluster from one `ManagedClusterSet` to another, you must have that permission available on both managed cluster sets. 

. Find the definition of the managed cluster in the `yaml` file. The section of the managed cluster definition where you add a label resembles the following content:
+
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: cluster1
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true 
----
+
In this example, `cluster1` is the name of the managed cluster.

. Add a label that specifies the name of the `ManagedClusterSet` in the format: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: clusterset1`.
+
Your code resembles the following example:
+
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: cluster1
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: clusterset1
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
----
+
In this example, `cluster1` is the cluster that is added to the managed cluster set names `clusterset1`.
+
*Note:* If the managed cluster was previously assigned to a managed cluster set that was deleted, the managed cluster might have a managed cluster set already specified to a cluster set that does not exist. If so, replace the name with the new one.

[#removing-a-managed-cluster-from-a-managedclusterset]
== Removing a managed cluster from a _ManagedClusterSet_

You might want to remove a managed cluster from a managed cluster set to move it to a different managed cluster set, or remove it from the management settings of the set. You can remove a managed cluster from a managed cluster set by using the console or the command-line interface. 

[#removing-a-managed-cluster-from-a-managedclusterset-console]
=== Removing a managed cluster from a _ManagedClusterSet_ by using the console

Complete the following steps to remove a cluster from a managed cluster set by using the {product-title-short} console:

. If you just created your managed cluster set, select *Manage resource assignments* to go directly to the _Manage resource assignments_ page. Continue with step 6 of this procedure. 

. If your cluster already exists, access the cluster page by selecting *Infrastructure* > *Clusters* in the main navigation.

. Select the _Cluster sets_ tab to view the available cluster sets. 

. Select the name of the cluster set that you want to remove from the managed cluster set to view the cluster set details.

. Select *Actions* > *Manage resource assignments*.

. On the _Manage resource assignments_ page, select the checkbox for the resources that you want to remove from the cluster set. 
+
This step removes a resource that is already a member of the cluster set, or adds a resource that is not already a member of the cluster set. You can see if the resource is already a member of a cluster set by viewing the details of the managed cluster.   

. Select `Review` and review your changes, then select `Save`.

**Note**: If you are moving a managed cluster from one managed cluster set to another, you must have the required RBAC permissions on both managed cluster sets.

[#removing-clusters-from-a-managedclusterset-cli]
=== Removing clusters from a _ManagedClusterSet_ by using the command line

To remove a managed cluster from a managed cluster set by using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command to display a list of managed clusters in the managed cluster set:
+
----
oc get managedclusters -l cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=<clusterset1>
----
+
Replace `clusterset1` with the name of the managed cluster set.

. Locate the entry for the cluster that you want to remove.

. Remove the label from the the `yaml` entry for the cluster that you want to remove. See the following code for an example of the label:
+
----
labels:
   cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: clusterset1
----

*Note:* If you are moving a managed cluster from one managed cluster set to another, you must have the required RBAC permission available on both managed cluster sets.

[#creating-a-managedclustersetbinding]
== Creating a _ManagedClusterSetBinding_ resource

Create a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource to bind a `ManagedClusterSet` resource to a namespace. Applications and policies that are created in the same namespace can only access managed clusters that are included in the bound managed cluster set resource. 

Access permissions to the namespace automatically apply to a managed cluster set that is bound to that namespace. If you have access permissions to access the namespace to which the managed cluster set is bound, you automatically have permissions to access any managed cluster set that is bound to that namespace. However, if you only have permissions to access the managed cluster set, you do not automatically have permissions to access other managed cluster sets on the namespace. If you do not see a managed cluster set, you might not have the required permissions to view it.

You can create a managed cluster set binding by using the console or the command line.  

[#creating-a-managedclustersetbinding-console]
=== Creating a _ManagedClusterSetBinding_ by using the console

Complete the following steps to remove a cluster from a managed cluster set by using the {product-title-short} console:

. Access the cluster page by selecting *Infrastructure* > *Clusters* in the main navigation.

. Select the _Cluster sets_ tab to view the available cluster sets. 

. Select the name of the cluster set that you want to create a binding for to view the cluster set details.

. Select *Actions* > *Edit namespace bindings*.

. On the _Edit namespace bindings_ page, select the namespace to which you want to bind the cluster set from the drop-down menu. The existing namespaces that have bindings to the cluster set are already selected. 

. Select *Save* to submit your changes.

[#creating-a-managedclustersetbinding-cli]
=== Creating a _ManagedClusterSetBinding_ by using the command line

To create a managed cluster set binding by using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Create the `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource in your `yaml` file. When you create a managed cluster set binding, the name of the managed cluster set binding must match the name of the managed cluster set to bind. Your `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource might resemble the following information:
+
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterSetBinding
metadata:
  namespace: project1
  name: clusterset1
spec:
  clusterSet: clusterset1
----

. Ensure that you have the bind permission on the target managed cluster set. View the following example of a `ClusterRole` resource, which contains rules that allow the user to bind to `clusterset1`:
+
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: clusterrole1
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["cluster.open-cluster-management.io"]
    resources: ["managedclustersets/bind"]
    resourceNames: ["clusterset1"]
    verbs: ["create"]
----

[#assign-role-clustersets]
=== Assigning users or groups Role-Based Access Control permissions to your _ManagedClusterSet_

You can assign users or groups to your cluster set that are provided by the configured identity providers on the hub cluster.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

The `ManagedClusterSet` API offers two levels of RBAC permissions:

* Cluster set `admin`
** Full access permissions to all of the cluster and cluster pool resources that are assigned to the managed cluster set.
** Permission to create clusters, import clusters, and create cluster pools. The permissions must be assigned to the managed cluster set when the managed cluster set is created.
* Cluster set `view`
** Read only permissions to all of the cluster and cluster pool resources that are assigned to the managed cluster set.
** No permission to create clusters, import clusters, or create cluster pools.

Complete the following steps to assign users or groups to your managed cluster set from the {product-title-short} console:

. From the main navigation menu of the console, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the _Cluster sets_ tab.

. Select your target cluster set. 

. Select the _Access management_ tab. 

. Select *Add user or group*.

. Search for, and select the user or group that you want to provide access.

. Select the *Cluster set admin* or *Cluster set view* role to give to the selected user or user group. See link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#overview-of-roles[Overview of roles] for more information about the role permissions.

. Select *Add* to submit the changes.

Your user or group is displayed in the table. It might take a few seconds for the permission assignments for all of the managed cluster set resources to be propagated to your user or group.

// 
//doc the association between clusterpool with clustersets, can provide access to create clusters in the pool and can help provide access to many users. Are there special roles for a clusterpool? 
//anyone bound to clusterset roles are able gain access to the clusterpools
// viewer can't create objects in a clusterpool 

For more information about role-based actions, see link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control].

See link:../clusters/placement_managed.adoc[Using ManagedClustersSets with Placement] for placement information.
