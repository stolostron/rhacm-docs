= Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets

A `ManagedClusterSet` is a group of managed clusters. With a managed cluster set, you can manage access to all of the managed clusters in the group together. You can also create a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource to bind a `ManagedClusterSet` resource to a namespace.

Each managed cluster must be a member of a `ManagedClusterSet`. When you install the hub cluster, a default `ManagedClusterSet` is created called `default`. All managed clusters that are not specifically assigned to a managed cluster set are automatically assigned to the `default` managed cluster set. To ensure that the default managed cluster set is always available, you cannot delete or update the `default` managed cluster set.

**Note:** Cluster pools that are not specifically added to a `ManagedClusterSet` are not added to the default `ManagedClusterSet`. After a managed cluster is claimed from a cluster pool, it is added to the default `ManagedClusterSet` if it is not specifically added to another `ManagedClusterSet`.
