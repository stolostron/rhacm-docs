// add prereq for users to managed cluster and managed cluster set 

A `ManagedClusterSet` is a group of managed clusters. With a managed cluster set, you can manage access to all of the managed clusters in the group together. You can also create a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource to bind a `ManagedClusterSet` resource to a namespace.
