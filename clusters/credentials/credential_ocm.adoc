= Creating a credential for Red Hat {ocm}

Add an {ocm} credential so that you can discover clusters.

[#prerequisites-discovery]
== Prerequisites

* *Required access:* Administrator
* You need an API token for the account, or you can use a separate Service Account.
+
* To obtain an API token, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_cluster_manager/1-latest/html/managing_clusters/assembly-managing-clusters#downloading-ocm-api-token_downloading-and-updating-pull-secrets[Downloading the {ocm} API token].
* To use a Service Account, you must obtain the client ID and client secret when you are creating the Service Account. Enter the credentials to create the {ocm} credential on your {mce}. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_hybrid_cloud_console/1-latest/html/creating_and_managing_service_accounts/proc-ciam-svc-acct-overview-creating-service-acct[Creating and managing a service account].

[#add-ocm-credential]
== Adding a credential by using the console

You need to add your credential to discover clusters. To create a credential from the {mce-short} console, complete the steps in the console:

. Log in to your cluster.
. Click *Credentials* > *Credential type* to choose from existing credential options. 
. Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, both for convenience and added security.
. Click *Add credential*.
. Select the Red Hat {ocm} option.
. Select one of the authentication methods.

*Notes:*

* When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential.

* If your credential is removed, or your {ocm} API token expires or is revoked, then the associated discovered clusters are removed.
