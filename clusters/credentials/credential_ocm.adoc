[#creating-a-credential-for-openshift-cluster-manager]
= Creating a credential for Red Hat {ocm}

Add an {ocm} credential so that you can discover clusters.

*Required access:* Administrator

[#prerequisites-discovery]
== Prerequisites

* You need access to a link:https://console.redhat.com/[console.redhat.com] account. Later you need the value that can be obtained by using API tokens or by using your Service Account credentials. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_cluster_manager/1-latest/html/managing_clusters/assembly-managing-clusters#downloading-ocm-api-token_downloading-and-updating-pull-secrets[Downloading the {ocm} API token].
* If you use a Service Account, you must enter the client ID and client secret to create the {ocm} credential on your {mce}. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_hybrid_cloud_console/1-latest/html/creating_and_managing_service_accounts/proc-ciam-svc-acct-overview-creating-service-acct[Creating and managing a servic account].

[#create-ocm-credential]
== Managing a credential by using the console

You need to add your credential to discover clusters. To create a credential from the {mce-short} console, complete the steps in the console:

. Log in to your cluster.
. Click *Credentials* to choose from existing credential options. *Tip:* Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, both for convenience and added security.
. Get your {ocm} API token. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_cluster_manager/1-latest/html/managing_clusters/assembly-managing-clusters#downloading-ocm-api-token_downloading-and-updating-pull-secrets[Downloading the {ocm} API token].
. Edit your credential in the console. 
. When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential. Select *Actions* to delete in bulk, or select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.

If your credential is removed, or your {ocm} API token expires or is revoked, then the associated discovered clusters are removed.
