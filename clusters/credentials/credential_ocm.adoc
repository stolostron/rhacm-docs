[#add-ocm-credential]
== Adding a credential by using the console

You need to add your credential to discover clusters. To create a credential from the {mce-short} console, complete the steps in the console:

. Log in to your cluster.
. Click *Credentials* > *Credential type* to choose from existing credential options. 
. Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, both for convenience and added security.
. Click *Add credential*.
. Select the Red Hat {ocm} option.
. Select the one of the authentication methods.

*Notes:*

* Delete the credential to protect the information in the credential.

* If your credential is removed, or your {ocm} API token expires or is revoked, then the associated discovered clusters are removed.
