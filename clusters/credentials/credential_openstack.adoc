[#creating-a-credential-for-openstack]
= Creating a credential for Red Hat OpenStack

You need a credential to use {mce-short} console to deploy and manage a supported {ocp} cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

*Notes:* You must create a credential for Red Hat OpenStack Platform before you can create a cluster with {mce-short}.

[#openstack-credential-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before you create a credential:

* A deployed hub cluster on a supported {ocp-short} version.
* Internet access for your hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.
* Red Hat OpenStack Platform login credentials and Red Hat OpenStack Platform requirements configured for {ocp-short} when using installer-provisioned infrastructure. See _Installing a cluster on OpenStack with customizations_.
* Download or create a `clouds.yaml` file for accessing the CloudStack API. Within the `clouds.yaml` file:
** Determine the cloud auth section name to use.
** Add a line for the *password*, immediately following the *username* line.

[#openstack-credential]
== Managing a credential by using the console

To create a credential from the {mce-short} console, complete the steps in the console. 

Start at the navigation menu. Click *Credentials* to choose from existing credential options. To enhance security and convenience, you can create a namespace specifically to host your credentials.

. *Optional:* You can add a Base DNS domain for your credential. If you add the base DNS domain, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this credential.

. Add your Red Hat OpenStack Platform `clouds.yaml` file contents. The contents of the `clouds.yaml` file, including the password, provide the required information for connecting to the Red Hat OpenStack Platform server. The file contents must include the password, which you add to a new line immediately after the `username`.

. Add your Red Hat OpenStack Platform cloud name. This entry is the name specified in the cloud section of the `clouds.yaml` to use for establishing communication to the Red Hat OpenStack Platform server.

. *Optional*: For configurations that use an internal certificate authority, enter your certificate in the *Internal CA certificate* field to automatically update your `clouds.yaml` with the certificate information.

. [[disconnected-openstack]]For disconnected installations only: Complete the fields in the *Configuration for disconnected installation* subsection with the required information:
+
* _Cluster OS image_: This value contains the URL to the image to use for {ocp} cluster machines. 

* _Image content sources_: This value contains the disconnected registry path. The path contains the hostname, port, and repository path to all of the installation images for disconnected installations. Example: `repository.com:5000/openshift/ocp-release`.
+
The path creates an image content source policy mapping in the `install-config.yaml` to the {ocp} release images. As an example, `repository.com:5000` produces this `imageContentSource` content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- mirrors:
  - registry.example.com:5000/ocp4
  source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release-nightly
- mirrors:
  - registry.example.com:5000/ocp4
  source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
- mirrors:
  - registry.example.com:5000/ocp4
  source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
----

* _Additional trust bundle_: This value provides the contents of the certificate file that is required to access the mirror registry.
+
*Note:* If you are deploying managed clusters from a hub that is in a disconnected environment, and want them to be automatically imported post install, add an Image Content Source Policy to the `install-config.yaml` file by using the `YAML` editor. A sample entry is shown in the following example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
- mirrors:
  - registry.example.com:5000/rhacm2
  source: registry.redhat.io/rhacm2
----

. [[proxy-openstack]]If you want to enable a proxy, enter the proxy information: 
+
* HTTP proxy URL: The URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

* HTTPS proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`. 

* No proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add an asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

* Additional trust bundle: One or more additional CA certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections.

. Enter your Red Hat OpenShift pull secret. See _Download your Red Hat OpenShift pull secret_ to download your pull secret.

. Add your SSH Private Key and SSH Public Key, which allows you to connect to the cluster.
You can use an existing key pair, or create a new one with key generation program.

. Click *Create*.

. Review the new credential information, then click *Add*. When you add the credential, it is added to the list of credentials.

You can create a cluster that uses this credential by completing the steps in _Creating a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform_.

You can edit your credential in the console. 

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential. Select *Actions* to delete in bulk, or select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.

[#osp-create-opaque-secret-api]
== Creating an opaque secret by using the API

To create an opaque secret for Red Hat OpenStack Platform by using the API instead of the console, apply YAML content in the YAML preview window that is similar to the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: <managed-cluster-name>-osp-creds
    namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
type: Opaque
data:
    clouds.yaml: $(base64 -w0 "${OSP_CRED_YAML}") cloud: $(echo -n "openstack" | base64 -w0)
----

*Notes:* 

- Opaque secrets are not visible in the console.

- Opaque secrets are created in the managed cluster namespace you chose. Hive uses the opaque secret to provision the cluster. When provisioning the cluster by using the {acm-short} console, the credentials you previoulsy created are copied to the managed cluster namespace as the opaque secret.
