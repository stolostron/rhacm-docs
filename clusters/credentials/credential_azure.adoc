[#creating-a-credential-for-microsoft-azure]
= Creating a credential for Microsoft Azure

You need a credential to use {mce-short} console to create and manage a {ocp} cluster on Microsoft Azure or on Microsoft Azure Government.

*Required access:* Edit

*Note:* This procedure is a prerequisite for creating a cluster with {mce-short}.

[#azure_cred_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a credential:

* A deployed {mce-short} hub cluster.
* Internet access for your {mce-short} hub cluster so that it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Azure.
* Azure login credentials, which include your Base Domain Resource Group and Azure Service Principal JSON. See _Microsoft Azure portal_ to get your login credentials.
* Account permissions that allow installing clusters on Azure. See _How to configure Cloud Services_ and _Configuring an Azure account_ for more information.

[#azure_cred]
== Managing a credential by using the console

To create a credential from the {mce-short} console, complete the steps in the console. Start at the navigation menu. Click *Credentials* to choose from existing credential options. *Tip:* Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, both for convenience and added security.

. *Optional:* Add a _Base DNS domain_ for your credential. If you add the base DNS domain to the credential, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this credential.

. Select whether the environment for your cluster is `AzurePublicCloud` or `AzureUSGovernmentCloud`. The settings are different for the Azure Government environment, so ensure that this is set correctly. 

. Add your _Base domain resource group name_ for your Azure account. This entry is the resource name that you created with your Azure account.
You can find your Base Domain Resource Group Name by selecting *Home* > *DNS Zones* in the Azure interface. See _Create an Azure service principal with the Azure CLI_ to find your base domain resource group name.

. Provide the contents for your _Client ID_. This value is generated as the `appId` property when you create a service principal with the following command: 
+
----
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --name <service_principal> --scopes <subscription_path>
----
Replace _service_principal_ with the name of your service principal.
. Add your _Client Secret_. This value is generated as the `password` property when you create a service principal with the following command:
+
----
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --name <service_principal> --scopes <subscription_path>
----
Replace _service_principal_ with the name of your service principal.

. Add your _Subscription ID_. This value is the `id` property in the output of the following command:
+
----
az account show
----
. Add your _Tenant ID_. This value is the `tenantId` property in the output of the following command:
+
----
az account show
----

. [[proxy-azure]]If you want to enable a proxy, enter the proxy information: 
+
* HTTP proxy URL: The URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

* HTTPS proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`. 

* No proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add an asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

* Additional trust bundle: One or more additional CA certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections.

. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift pull secret_. See _Download your Red Hat OpenShift pull secret_ to download your pull secret.

. Add your _SSH private key_ and _SSH public key_ to use to connect to the cluster. You can use an existing key pair, or create a new pair using a key generation program.

You can create a cluster that uses this credential by completing the steps in _Creating a cluster on Microsoft Azure_.

You can edit your credential in the console. 

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential. Select *Actions* to delete in bulk, or select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.

[#azure-create-opaque-secret-api]
== Creating an opaque secret by using the API

To create an opaque secret for Microsoft Azure by using the API instead of the console, apply YAML content in the YAML preview window that is similar to the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: <managed-cluster-name>-azure-creds
    namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
type: Opaque
data:
    baseDomainResourceGroupName: $(echo -n "${azure_resource_group_name}" | base64 -w0)
    osServicePrincipal.json: $(base64 -w0 "${AZURE_CRED_JSON}")
----

*Notes:* 

- Opaque secrets are not visible in the console.

- Opaque secrets are created in the managed cluster namespace you chose. Hive uses the opaque secret to provision the cluster. When provisioning the cluster by using the {acm-short} console, the credentials you previoulsy created are copied to the managed cluster namespace as the opaque secret.
