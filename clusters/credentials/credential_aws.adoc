[#creating-a-credential-for-amazon-web-services]
= Creating a credential for Amazon Web Services

You need a credential to use {mce-short} console to deploy and manage an {ocp} cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

*Required access:* Edit

*Note:* This procedure must be done before you can create a cluster with {mce-short}.

[#aws_cred_prereqs]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a credential:

* A deployed {mce-short} hub cluster
* Internet access for your {mce-short} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* AWS login credentials, which include access key ID and secret access key. See _Understanding and getting your security credentials_.
* Account permissions that allow installing clusters on AWS. See _Configuring an AWS account_ for instructions on how to configure an AWS account.

[#aws_cred_create]
== Managing a credential by using the console

To create a credential from the {mce-short} console, complete the steps in the console. 

Start at the navigation menu. Click *Credentials* to choose from existing credential options. *Tip:* Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, both for convenience and added security.

You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your credential. If you add the base DNS domain to the credential, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this credential. See the following steps:

. Add your _AWS access key ID_ for your AWS account. See _Log in to AWS_ to find your ID.

. Provide the contents for your new _AWS Secret Access Key_.

. [[proxy-aws]]If you want to enable a proxy, enter the proxy information: 
+
* HTTP proxy URL: The URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

* HTTPS proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`. 

* No proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add an asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

* Additional trust bundle: One or more additional CA certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections.

. Enter your Red Hat OpenShift pull secret. See _Download your Red Hat OpenShift pull secret_ to download your pull secret.

. Add your _SSH private key_ and _SSH public key_, which allows you to connect to the cluster. You can use an existing key pair, or create a new one with key generation program.

You can create a cluster that uses this credential by completing the steps in _Creating a cluster on Amazon Web Services_ or _Creating a cluster on Amazon Web Services GovCloud_.

You can edit your credential in the console. If the cluster was created by using this provider connection, then the `<cluster-name>-aws-creds>` secret from `<cluster-namespace>` will get updated with the new credentials.

*Note:* Updating credentials does not work for cluster pool claimed clusters.

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential. Select *Actions* to delete in bulk, or select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.

[#aws_s3_create]
=== Creating an S3 secret

To create an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) secret, complete the following task from the console:

. Click *Add credential* > *AWS* > *S3 Bucket*. If you click *For Hosted Control Plane*, the name and namespace are provided. 

. Enter information for the following fields that are provided:
+
- `bucket name`: Add the name of the S3 bucket.
- `aws_access_key_id`: Add your AWS access key ID for your AWS account. Log in to AWS to find your ID.
- `aws_secret_access_key`: Provide the contents for your new AWS Secret Access Key.
- `Region`: Enter your AWS region.

[#aws-create-opaque-secret-api]
== Creating an opaque secret by using the API

To create an opaque secret for Amazon Web Services by using the API, apply YAML content in the YAML preview window that is similar to the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: <managed-cluster-name>-aws-creds
    namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
type: Opaque
data:
    aws_access_key_id: $(echo -n "${AWS_KEY}" | base64 -w0)
    aws_secret_access_key: $(echo -n "${AWS_SECRET}" | base64 -w0)
----

*Notes:* 

- Opaque secrets are not visible in the console.

- Opaque secrets are created in the managed cluster namespace you chose. Hive uses the opaque secret to provision the cluster. When provisioning the cluster by using the {acm-short} console, the credentials you previoulsy created are copied to the managed cluster namespace as the opaque secret.

- Add labels to your credentials to view your secret in the console. For example, the following AWS S3 Bucket `oc label secret` is appended with `type=awss3` and `credentials --from-file=....`:

----
oc label secret hypershift-operator-oidc-provider-s3-credentials -n local-cluster "cluster.open-cluster-management.io/type=awss3"
oc label secret hypershift-operator-oidc-provider-s3-credentials -n local-cluster "cluster.open-cluster-management.io/credentials=credentials="
