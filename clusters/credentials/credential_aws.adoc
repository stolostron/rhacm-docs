[#creating-a-credential-for-amazon-web-services]
= Creating a credential for Amazon Web Services

You need a credential to use {mce} console to deploy and manage an {ocp} cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

*Required access:* Edit

*Note:* This procedure must be done before you can create a cluster with {mce}.

[#aws_cred_prereqs]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a credential:

* A deployed {mce} hub cluster
* Internet access for your {mce} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* AWS login credentials, which include access key ID and secret access key.
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html[Understanding and getting your security credentials].
* Account permissions that allow installing clusters on AWS.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.html[Configuring an AWS account] for instructions on how to configure.

[#aws_cred_create]
== Managing a credential by using the console

To create a credential from the {mce} console, complete the steps in the console. 

Start at the navigation menu. Click *Credentials* to choose from existing credential options. *Tip:* Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, both for convenience and added security.

You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your credential. If you add the base DNS domain to the credential, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this credential. See the following steps:

. Add your _AWS access key ID_ for your AWS account. Log in to https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials[AWS] to find your ID.
. Provide the contents for your new _AWS Secret Access Key_.
. [[proxy-aws]]If you want to enable a proxy, enter the proxy information: 
+
* HTTP proxy URL: The URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

* HTTPS proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`. 

* No proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add and asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

* Additional trust bundle: One or more additional CA certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections.
. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift pull secret_. You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH private key_ and _SSH public key_, which allows you to connect to the cluster. You can use an existing key pair, or create a new one with key generation program.

See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-default.html#ssh-agent-using_installing-aws-default[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent] for more information about how to generate a key.

You can create a cluster that uses this credential by completing the steps in xref:../cluster_lifecycle/create_ocp_aws.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-amazon-web-services[Creating a cluster on Amazon Web Services] or xref:../cluster_lifecycle/create_aws_govcloud.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-amazon-web-services[Creating a cluster on Amazon Web Services GovCloud].

You can edit your credential in the console. If the cluster was created by using this provider connection, then the `<cluster-name>-aws-creds>` secret from `<cluster-namespace>` will get updated with the new credentials.

*Note:* Updating credentials does not work for cluster pool claimed clusters.

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential. Select *Actions* to delete in bulk, or select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.

[#aws-create-opaque-secret-api]
== Creating an opaque secret by using the API

To create an opaque secret for Amazon Web Services by using the API, apply YAML content in the YAML preview window that is similar to the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: <managed-cluster-name>-aws-creds
    namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
type: Opaque
data:
    aws_access_key_id: $(echo -n "${AWS_KEY}" | base64 -w0)
    aws_secret_access_key: $(echo -n "${AWS_SECRET}" | base64 -w0)
----

*Note:* The opaque secret is created in the managed cluster namespace you chose. Hive uses the opaque secret to provision the cluster. When provisioning the cluster by using the {product-title-short} console, the credentials you previoulsy created are copied to the managed cluster namespace as the opaque secret.
