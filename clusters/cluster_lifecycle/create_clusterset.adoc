[#creating-a-managedclusterset]
= Creating a _ManagedClusterSet_

You can group managed clusters together in a managed cluster set to limit the user access on managed clusters.  

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

A `ManagedClusterSet` is a cluster-scoped resource, so you must have cluster administration permissions for the cluster where you are creating the `ManagedClusterSet`. A managed cluster cannot be included in more than one `ManagedClusterSet`. You can create a managed cluster set from either the {mce-short} console or from the CLI.

*Note:* Cluster pools that are not added to a managed cluster set are not added to the default `ManagedClusterSet` resource. After a cluster is claimed from the cluster pool, the cluster is added to the default `ManagedClusterSet`.

[#managedclustersets_global]
== _ManagedClusterSets_ global bind

When you create a managed cluster, the following are automatically created to ease management:

- A `ManagedClusterSet` called `global`.
- The namespace called `open-cluster-management-global-set`.
- A `ManagedClusterSetBinding` called `global` to bind the `global` `ManagedClusterSet` to the `open-cluster-management-global-set` namespace.
+
*Important:* You cannot delete, update, or edit the `global` managed cluster set. The `global` managed cluster set includes all managed clusters. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2
kind: ManagedClusterSetBinding
metadata:
  name: global
  namespace: open-cluster-management-global-set
spec:
  clusterSet: global
----

[#creating-managedclusterset-cli]
== Creating a ManagedClusterSet by using the CLI

Add the following definition of the managed cluster set to your YAML file to create a managed cluster set by using the CLI:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2
kind: ManagedClusterSet
metadata:
  name: <cluster_set>
----

Replace `<cluster_set>` with the name of your managed cluster set.

[#adding-cluster-managedclusterset]
== Adding a cluster to a _ManagedClusterSet_

After you create your `ManagedClusterSet`, you can add clusters to your managed cluster set by either following the instructions in the console or by using the CLI.

[#adding-clusters-managedclusterset-cli]
== Adding clusters to a _ManagedClusterSet_ by using the CLI

Complete the following steps to add a cluster to a managed cluster set by using the CLI:

. Ensure that there is an RBAC `ClusterRole` entry that allows you to create on a virtual subresource of `managedclustersets/join`.
+
*Note:* Without this permission, you cannot assign a managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`. If this entry does not exist, add it to your YAML file. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: clusterrole1
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["cluster.open-cluster-management.io"]
    resources: ["managedclustersets/join"]
    resourceNames: ["<cluster_set>"]
    verbs: ["create"]
----
+
Replace `<cluster_set>` with the name of your `ManagedClusterSet`.
+
*Note:* If you are moving a managed cluster from one `ManagedClusterSet` to another, you must have that permission available on both managed cluster sets. 

. Find the definition of the managed cluster in the YAML file. See the following example definition:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name>
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true 
----

. Add the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset` paremeter and specify the name of the `ManagedClusterSet`. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name>
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: <cluster_set>
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
