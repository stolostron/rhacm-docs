[#importing-managed-agent]
= Importing a managed cluster by using agent registration

After you install {mce}, you are ready to import a cluster and manage it by using the agent registration endpoint. Continue reading the following topics to learn how to import a managed cluster by using the agent registration endpoint.

* <<import-agent-prereqs,Prerequisites>>
* <<supported-architectures-agent,Supported architectures>>
* <<cluster-import-agent,Importing a cluster>>

[#import-agent-prereqs]
== Prerequisites

* A deployed hub cluster. If you are importing bare metal clusters, the hub cluster must be installed on a supported {ocp-short} version. 
* A cluster you want to manage.
* The `base64` command line tool.
* A defined `multiclusterhub.spec.imagePullSecret` if you are importing a cluster that was not created by {ocp-short}. This secret might have been created when {mce} was installed. See xref:../install_upgrade/adv_config_install.adoc#custom-image-pull-secret[Custom image pull secret] for more information about how to define this secret.
+
If you need to create a new secret, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/import_gui.adoc#creating-new-pull-secret[Creating a new pull secret].

[#supported-architectures-agent]
== Supported architectures

* Linux (x86_64, s390x, ppc64le)
* macOS

[#cluster-import-agent]
== Importing a cluster

To import a managed cluster by using the agent registration endpoint, complete the following steps:

. Get the agent registration server URL by running the following command on the hub cluster:
+
----
export agent_registration_host=$(oc get route -n multicluster-engine agent-registration -o=jsonpath="{.spec.host}")
----
+
*Note:* If your hub cluster is using a cluster-wide-proxy, make sure that you are using the URL that managed cluster can access.

. Get the cacert by running the following command:
+
----
oc get configmap -n kube-system kube-root-ca.crt -o=jsonpath="{.data['ca\.crt']}" > ca.crt_
----
+
*Note:* If you are not using the `kube-root-ca` issued endpoint, use the public `agent-registration` API endpoint CA instead of the `kube-root-ca` CA.


. Get the token for the agent registration sever to authorize by applying the following YAML content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: managed-cluster-import-agent-registration-sa
  namespace: multicluster-engine
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
metadata:
  name: managed-cluster-import-agent-registration-sa-token
  namespace: multicluster-engine
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: "managed-cluster-import-agent-registration-sa"
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: managedcluster-import-controller-agent-registration-client
rules:
- nonResourceURLs: ["/agent-registration/*"]
  verbs: ["get"]
---
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: managed-cluster-import-agent-registration
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: managedcluster-import-controller-agent-registration-client
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: managed-cluster-import-agent-registration-sa
    namespace: multicluster-engine 
----

. Run the following command to export the token:
+
----
export token=$(oc get secret -n multicluster-engine managed-cluster-import-agent-registration-sa-token -o=jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
----

. Enable the automatic approval and patch the content to `cluster-manager` by running the following command:
+
----
oc patch clustermanager cluster-manager --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"registrationConfiguration":{"featureGates":[
{"feature": "ManagedClusterAutoApproval", "mode": "Enable"}], "autoApproveUsers":["system:serviceaccount:multicluster-engine:agent-registration-bootstrap"]}}}'
----
+
*Note:* You can also disable automatic approval and manually approve certificate signing requests from managed clusters.

. Switch to your managed cluster and get the cacert by running the following command:
+
----
curl --cacert ca.crt -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" https://$agent_registration_host/agent-registration/crds/v1 | oc apply -f -
----

. Run the following command to import the managed cluster to the hub cluster:
+
Replace `<clusterName>` with the name of you cluster.
+
*Optional:* Replace `<klusterletconfigName>` with the name of your KlusterletConfig.
+
----
curl --cacert ca.crt -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" https://$agent_registration_host/agent-registration/manifests/<clusterName>?klusterletconfig=<klusterletconfigName> | oc apply -f -
