= ClusterClaims

A `_ClusterClaim_` is a cluster-scoped custom resource definition (CRD) on a managed cluster. A ClusterClaim represents a piece of information that a managed cluster claims. You can use the ClusterClaim to detemine the Placement of the resource on the target clusters.

The following example shows a ClusterClaim that is identified in the YAML file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterClaim
metadata:
  name: id.openshift.io
spec:
  value: 95f91f25-d7a2-4fc3-9237-2ef633d8451c
----

The following table shows the defined ClusterClaims that might be on a cluster that {mce-short} manages:

[cols="4"]
|===
| Claim name | Reserved | Mutable | Description 

| `id.k8s.io` | true | false | ClusterID defined in upstream proposal
| `kubeversion.open-cluster-management.io` | true | true | Kubernetes version
| `platform.open-cluster-management.io` | true | false | Platform the managed cluster is running on, like AWS, GCE, and Equinix Metal
| `product.open-cluster-management.io` | true | false |  Product name, like OpenShift, Anthos, EKS and GKE
| `id.openshift.io` | false | false | {ocp-short} external ID, which is only available for an {ocp-short} cluster 
| `consoleurl.openshift.io` | false | true | URL of the management console, which is only available for an {ocp-short} cluster
| `version.openshift.io` | false | true | {ocp-short} version, which is only available for an {ocp-short} cluster
|===

If any of the previous claims are deleted or updated on managed cluster, they are restored or rolled back to a previous version automatically.

After the managed cluster joins the hub, the ClusterClaims that are created on a managed cluster are synchronized with the status of the `ManagedCluster` resource on the hub. A managed cluster with ClusterClaims might look similar to the following example:

[source,yaml]
