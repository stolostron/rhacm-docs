[#scaling-machinepool]
= Scaling with MachinePool

For clusters that you provision with {mce-short}, a `MachinePool` resource is automatically created for you. You can further customize and resize your managed cluster specifications, such as virtual machine sizes and number of nodes, by using `MachinePool`.

- Using the `MachinePool` resource is not supported for bare metal clusters.

- A `MachinePool` resource is a Kubernetes resource on the hub cluster that groups the `MachineSet` resources together on the managed cluster. 

- The `MachinePool` resource uniformly configures a set of machine resources, including zone configurations, instance type, and root storage. 

- With `MachinePool`, you can manually configure the desired number of nodes or configure autoscaling of nodes on the managed cluster.

[#configure-autoscale]
== Configure autoscaling

Configuring autoscaling provides the flexibility of your cluster to scale as needed to lower your cost of resources by scaling down when traffic is low, and by scaling up to ensure that there are enough resources when there is a higher demand for resources. 

* To enable autoscaling on your `MachinePool` resources using the console, complete the following steps:

. In the navigation, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 

. Click the name of your target cluster and select the _Machine pools_ tab.

. From the machine pools page, select *Enable autoscale* from the _Options_ menu for the target machine pool.

. Select the minimum and maximum number of machine set replicas. A machine set replica maps directly to a node on the cluster. 
+
The changes might take several minutes to reflect on the console after you click *Scale*. You can view the status of the scaling operation by clicking *View machines* in the notification of the _Machine pools_ tab. 

* To enable autoscaling on your `MachinePool` resources using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Enter the following command to view your list of machine pools, replacing `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your target managed cluster.
+
----
oc get machinepools -n <managed-cluster-namespace>
----

. Enter the following command to edit the YAML file for the machine pool:
+
----
oc edit machinepool <MachinePool-resource-name> -n <managed-cluster-namespace>
----
+
- Replace `MachinePool-resource-name` with the name of your `MachinePool` resource. 
+
- Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the name of the namespace of your managed cluster.

. Delete the `spec.replicas` field from the YAML file.

. Add the `spec.autoscaling.minReplicas` setting and `spec.autoscaling.maxReplicas` fields to the resource YAML. 

. Add the minimum number of replicas to the `minReplicas` setting.

. Add the maximum number of replicas into the `maxReplicas` setting.

. Save the file to submit the changes.

[#machinepools-autoscale-disable]
== Disabling autoscaling

You can disable autoscaling by using the console or the command line. 

* To disable autoscaling by using the console, complete the following steps:

. In the navigation, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 

. Click the name of your target cluster and select the _Machine pools_ tab.

. From the machine pools page, select *Disable autoscale* from the _Options_ menu for the target machine pool.

. Select the number of machine set replicas that you want. A machine set replica maps directly with a node on the cluster. 
+
It might take several minutes to display in the console after you click *Scale*. You can view the status of the scaling by clicking *View machines* in the notification on the _Machine pools_ tab.

* To disable autoscaling by using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Enter the following command to view your list of machine pools:
+
----
oc get machinepools -n <managed-cluster-namespace>
----
Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your target managed cluster.

. Enter the following command to edit the YAML file for the machine pool:
+
----
oc edit machinepool <name-of-MachinePool-resource> -n <namespace-of-managed-cluster>
----
Replace `name-of-MachinePool-resource` with the name of your `MachinePool` resource. 
+
Replace `namespace-of-managed-cluster` with the name of the namespace of your managed cluster.

. Delete the `spec.autoscaling` field from the YAML file.

. Add the `spec.replicas` field to the resource YAML. 

. Add the number of replicas to the `replicas` setting.

. Save the file to submit the changes.

[#machinepools-manual-scale]
== Enabling manual scaling

You can scale manually from the console and from the command line.

[#manual-console]
=== Enabling manual scaling with the console

To scale your `MachinePool` resources using the console, complete the following steps:

. Disable autoscaling for your `MachinePool` if it is enabled. See the previous steps.

. From the console, click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Click the name of your target cluster and select the _Machine pools_ tab.

. From the machine pools page, select *Scale machine pool* from the _Options_ menu for the targeted machine pool.

. Select the number of machine set replicas that you want. A machine set replica maps directly with a node on the cluster. Changes might take several minutes to reflect on the console after you click *Scale*. You can view the status of the scaling operation by clicking *View machines* from the notification of the Machine pools tab.

[#manual-cli]
=== Enabling manual scaling with the command line

To scale your `MachinePool` resources by using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Enter the following command to view your list of machine pools, replacing `<managed-cluster-namespace>` with the namespace of your target managed cluster namespace:

+
----
oc get machinepools -n <managed-cluster-namespace>
----

. Enter the following command to edit the YAML file for the machine pool:

+
----
oc edit machinepool <MachinePool-resource-name> -n <managed-cluster-namespace>
----
+
- Replace `MachinePool-resource-name` with the name of your `MachinePool` resource.
+
- Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the name of the namespace of your managed cluster.

. Delete the `spec.autoscaling` field from the YAML file.

. Modify the `spec.replicas` field in the YAML file with the number of replicas you want.

. Save the file to submit the changes.
