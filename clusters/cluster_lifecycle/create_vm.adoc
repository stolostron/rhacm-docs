[#creating-a-cluster-on-vmware-vsphere]
= Creating a cluster on VMware vSphere

You can use the {mce-short} console to deploy a {ocp} cluster on VMware vSphere.

When you create a cluster, the creation process uses the {ocp-short} installer with the Hive resource. If you have questions about cluster creation after completing this procedure, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/installing/installing-on-vsphere[Installing on vSphere] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information about the process.

[#vsphere_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

See the following prerequisites before creating a cluster on vSphere:

* You must have a hub cluster that is deployed on {ocp-short} version 4.12 or later.
* You need a vSphere credential. See xref:../credentials/credential_vm.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-vmware-vsphere[Creating a credential for VMware vSphere] for more information.
* You need an {ocp-short} image pull secret. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets].
* You must have the following information for the VMware instance where you are deploying:
** Required static IP addresses for API and Ingress instances
** DNS records for:
- The following API base domain must point to the static API VIP:
+
[source,bash]
----
api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
----

- The following application base domain must point to the static IP address for Ingress VIP:
+
[source,bash]
----
*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
----

[#vsphere_creating-your-cluster-with-the-console]
== Creating your cluster with the console

To create a cluster from the {mce-short} console, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. On the _Clusters_ page, click *Create cluster* and complete the steps in the console.

*Note:* This procedure is for creating a cluster. If you have an existing cluster that you want to import, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/import_intro.adoc#import-intro[Cluster import introduction] for those steps.

If you need to create a credential, see xref:../credentials/credential_vm.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-vmware-vsphere[Creating a credential for VMware vSphere] for more information about creating a credential.

The name of your cluster is used in the hostname of the cluster. 

*Important:* When you create a cluster, the controller creates a namespace for the cluster and its resources. Ensure that you include only resources for that cluster instance in that namespace. Destroying the cluster deletes the namespace and all of the resources in it.

*Tip:* Select *YAML: On* to view content updates as you enter the information in the console.

If you want to add your cluster to an existing cluster set, you must have the correct permissions on the cluster set to add it. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges when you are creating the cluster, you must select a cluster set on which you have `clusterset-admin` permissions. If you do not have the correct permissions on the specified cluster set, the cluster creation fails. Contact your cluster administrator to provide you with `clusterset-admin` permissions to a cluster set if you do not have any cluster set options to select.

Every managed cluster must be associated with a managed cluster set. If you do not assign the managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

If there is already a base domain associated with the selected credential that you configured for your vSphere account, that value is populated in the field. You can change the value by overwriting it. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/installing/installing-on-vsphere#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations[Installing a cluster on vSphere with customizations] for more information. This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section. This name is used in the hostname of the cluster. 

The release image identifies the version of the {ocp-short} image that is used to create the cluster. If the version that you want to use is available, you can select the image from the list of images. If the image that you want to use is not a standard image, you can enter the URL to the image that you want to use. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/release_image_intro.adoc#release-images-intro[Release images] for more information about release images.

*Note:* Release images for {ocp-short} versions 4.12 and later are supported.

The node pools include the control plane pool and the worker pools. The control plane nodes share the management of the cluster activity. The information includes the _CPU architecture_ field. View the following field description:

* CPU architecture: If the architecture type of the managed cluster is not the same as the architecture of your hub cluster, enter a value for the instruction set architecture of the machines in the pool. Valid values are _amd64_, _ppc64le_, _s390x_, and _arm64_.
 
You can create one or more worker nodes in a worker pool to run the container workloads for the cluster. They can be in a single worker pool, or distributed across multiple worker pools. If zero worker nodes are specified, the control plane nodes also function as worker nodes. The information includes _Cores per socket_, _CPUs_, _Memory_min MiB, _Disk size_ in GiB, and _Node count_. 

Networking information is required. Multiple networks are required for using IPv6. Some of the required networking information is included the following fields: 
 
* vSphere network name: Specify the VMware vSphere network name.

* API VIP: Specify the IP address to use for internal API communication.
+
*Note:* This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section. If not provided, the DNS must be pre-configured so that `api.` resolves correctly.

* Ingress VIP: Specify the IP address to use for ingress traffic. 
+
*Note:* This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section. If not provided, the DNS must be pre-configured so that `test.apps.` resolves correctly.

You can add an additional network by clicking *Add network*. You must have more than one network if you are using IPv6 addresses. 

Proxy information that is provided in the credential is automatically added to the proxy fields. You can use the information as it is, overwrite it, or add the information if you want to enable a proxy. The following list contains the required information for creating a proxy:  

* HTTP proxy: Specify the URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

* HTTPS proxy: Specify the secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.

* No proxy sites: Provide a comma-separated list of sites that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add an asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

* Additional trust bundle: One or more additional CA certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections.

You can define the disconnected installation image by clicking *Disconnected installation*. When creating a cluster by using Red Hat OpenStack Platform provider and disconnected installation, if a certificate is required to access the mirror registry, you must enter it in the _Additional trust bundle_ field in the _Configuration for disconnected installation_ section when configuring your credential or the _Disconnected installation_ section when creating a cluster.

You can click *Add automation template* to create a template. 
 
When you review your information and optionally customize it before creating the cluster, you can click the *YAML* switch *On* to view the `install-config.yaml` file content in the panel. You can edit the YAML file with your custom settings, if you have any updates. 

If you are using {product-title} and want to configure your managed cluster klusterlet to run on specific nodes, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/adv_config_cluster.adoc#create-cluster-configuring-nodeselector-tolerations[Optional: Configuring the klusterlet to run on specific nodes] for the required steps.

*Note:* You do not have to run the `oc` command that is provided with the cluster details to import the cluster. When you create the cluster, it is automatically configured under the management of {mce-short}.

Continue with xref:../cluster_lifecycle/access_cluster.adoc#accessing-your-cluster[Accessing your cluster] for instructions for accessing your cluster.
