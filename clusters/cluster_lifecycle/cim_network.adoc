[#cim-network-config]
= Configuring advanced networking for an infrastructure environment

For hosts that require networking beyond DHCP on a single interface, you must configure advanced networking. The required configuration includes creating one or more instances of the `NMStateConfig` resource that describes the networking for one or more hosts. 

Each `NMStateConfig` resource must contain a label that matches the `nmStateConfigLabelSelector` on your `InfraEnv` resource. See _Creating a host inventory by using the command line interface_ to learn more about the `nmStateConfigLabelSelector`.

The Discovery Image contains the network configurations defined in all referenced `NMStateConfig` resources. After booting, each host compares each configuration to its network interfaces and applies the appropriate configuration.

[#cim-network-prereqs]
== Prerequisites

- You must enable the central infrastructure management service.
- You must create a host inventory.

== Configuring advanced networking by using the command line interface

To configure advanced networking for your infrastructure environment by using the command line interface, complete the following steps:

. Create a file named `nmstateconfig.yaml` and add content that is similar to the following template:
+
[source,yaml]

<1> Use a name that is relevant to the host or hosts you are configuring.
<2> The namespace must match the namespace of your `InfraEnv` resource.  
<3> Add one or more labels that match the `nmStateConfigLabelSelector` on your `InfraEnv` resource.
<4> Describes the network settings in `NMstate` format. See _Declarative Network API_ for the format specification and additional examples. The configuration can also apply to a single host, where you have one `NMStateConfig` resource per host, or can describe the interfaces for multiple hosts in a single `NMStateConfig` resource.
<5> Describes the mapping between interface names found in the specified `NMstate` configuration and MAC addresses found on the hosts. Make sure the mapping uses physical interfaces present on a host. For example, when the `NMState` configuration defines a bond or VLAN, the mapping  only contains an entry for parent interfaces. The mapping has the following purposes:
* Allows you to use interface names in the configuration that do not match the interface names on a host. You might find this useful because the operating system chooses the interface names, which might not be predictable.
* Tells a host what MAC addresses to look for after booting and applies the correct `NMstate` configuration.
+
*Note:* The Image Service automatically creates a new image when you update any `InfraEnv` properties or change the `NMStateConfig` resources that match its label selector. If you add `NMStateConfig` resources after creating the `InfraEnv` resource, make sure that the `InfraEnv` creates a new Discovery Image by checking the `createdTime` property in your `InfraEnv`. If you already booted hosts, boot them again with the latest Discovery Image.

. Apply the YAML content by running the following command:
+

oc apply -f nmstateconfig.yaml
