[#manage-host-inv]
= Managing your host inventory

You can manage your host inventory and edit existing hosts by using the console, or by using the command line interface and editing the `Agent` resource.

[#manage-host-inv-console]
== Managing your host inventory by using the console

Each host that you successfully boot with the Discovery ISO appears as a row in your host inventory. You can use the console to edit and manage your hosts. If you booted the host manually and are not using the bare metal operator automation, you must approve the host in the console before you can use it. Hosts that are ready to be installed as OpenShift nodes have the `Available` status. 

[#manage-host-inv-cli]
== Managing your host inventory by using the command line interface

An `Agent` resource represents each host. You can set the following properties in an `Agent` resource:

- `clusterDeploymentName`
+
Set this property to the namespace and name of the `ClusterDeployment` you want to use if you want to install the host as a node in a cluster.
- *Optional:* `role`
+
Sets the role for the host in the cluster. Possible values are `master`, `worker`, and `auto-assign`. The default value is `auto-assign`.
- `hostname`
+
Sets the host name for the host. Optional if the host is automatically assigned a valid host name, for example by using DHCP.
- `approved`
+
Indicates if the host can be installed as an OpenShift node. This property is a boolean with a default value of `False`.  If you booted the host manually and are not using the bare metal operator automation, you must set this property to `True` before installing the host.
- `installation_disk_id`
+
The ID of the installation disk you chose that is visible in the inventory of the host.
- `installerArgs`
+
A JSON-formatted string containing overrides for the _coreos-installer_ arguments of the host. You can use this property to modify kernel arguments. See the following example syntax:
+
----
["--append-karg", "ip=192.0.2.2::192.0.2.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none", "--save-partindex", "4"]
----
- `ignitionConfigOverrides`
+
A JSON-formatted string containing overrides for the ignition configuration of the host. You can use this property to add files to the host by using ignition. See the following example syntax:
+
----
{"ignition": "version": "3.1.0"}, "storage": {"files": [{"path": "/tmp/example", "contents": {"source": "data:text/plain;base64,aGVscGltdHJhcHBlZGluYXN3YWdnZXJzcGVj"}}]}}
----
- `nodeLabels`
+
A list of labels that are applied to the node after the host is installed.
The `status` of an `Agent` resource has the following properties:

- `role`
+
Sets the role for the host in the cluster. If you previously set a `role` in the `Agent` resource, the value appears in the `status`.
- `inventory`
+
Contains host properties that the agent running on the host discovers.
- `progress`
+
The host installation progress.
- `ntpSources`
+
The configured Network Time Protocol (NTP) sources of the host.
- `conditions`
+
Contains the following standard Kubernetes conditions with a `True` or `False` value:
+
** SpecSynced: `True` if all specified properties are successfully applied. `False` if some error was encountered.
** Connected: `True` if the agent connection to the installation service is not obstructed. `False` if the agent has not contacted the installation service in some time.
** RequirementsMet: `True` if the host is ready to begin the installation.
** Validated: `True` if all host validations pass.
** Installed: `True` if the host is installed as an OpenShift node.
** Bound: `True` if the host is bound to a cluster.
** Cleanup: `False` if the request to delete the `Agent` resouce fails.
- `debugInfo`
+
Contains URLs for downloading installation logs and events.
- `validationsInfo`
+
Contains information about validations that the agent runs after the host is discovered to ensure that the installation is successful. Troubleshoot if the value is `False`.
- `installation_disk_id`
+
The ID of the installation disk you chose that is visible in the inventory of the host.
