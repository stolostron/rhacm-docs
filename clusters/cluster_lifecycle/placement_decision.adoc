[#placement-decision]
= Checking selected _ManagedClusters_ by using _PlacementDecisions_

One or more `PlacementDecision` kinds with the label `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement_name}` are created to represent `ManagedClusters` selected by a placement.

If a `ManagedCluster` is selected and added to a `PlacementDecision`, components that consume this placement might apply the workload on this `ManagedCluster`. After the `ManagedCluster` is no longer selected and is removed from the `PlacementDecision`, the workload that is applied on this `ManagedCluster` is removed. See _PlacementDecisions API_ to learn more about the API.


See the following `PlacementDecision` example:
