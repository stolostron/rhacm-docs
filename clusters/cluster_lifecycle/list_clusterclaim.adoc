[#list-clusterclaims]
= List existing ClusterClaims


You can use the `kubectl` command to list the ClusterClaims that apply to your managed cluster so that you can compare your ClusterClaim to an error message. 

*Note:* Make sure you have `list` permission on resource `clusterclaims.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`.

Run the following command to list all existing ClusterClaims that are on the managed cluster:

----
kubectl get clusterclaims.cluster.open-cluster-management.io
----
//this may or may not be an instance where we use kubectl appropriately. @oliver will you check on this one?

//Additionally I had this old comment where I asked the previous writer not to use one file for this command. I don't think we followed up on this. Isn't there another place that we introduce `clusterclaims.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` where we can reduce the need to a whole file here? Even if not for this release, maybe for tech debt?
