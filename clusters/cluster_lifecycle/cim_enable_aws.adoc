= Enabling central infrastructure management on Amazon Web Services

If you are running your hub cluster on Amazon Web Services and want to enable the central infrastructure management service, complete the following steps after xref:cim_enable.adoc#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service]:

. Make sure you are logged in at the hub cluster and find the unique domain configured on the `assisted-image-service` by running the following command:
+
----
oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep assisted-image-service
----
//do we get routes with the integrated console? A bug came out for other topics, could not get a review on this in time, please check next time this is edited. --bcs 6/23
+
Your domain might resemble the following example: `assisted-image-service-multicluster-engine.apps.<yourdomain>.com`

. Make sure you are logged in at the hub cluster and create a new `IngressController` with a unique domain using the `NLB` `type` parameter. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: ingress-controller-with-nlb
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  domain: nlb-apps.<domain>.com
  routeSelector:
      matchLabels:
        router-type: nlb
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: LoadBalancerService
    loadBalancer:
      scope: External
      providerParameters:
        type: AWS
        aws:
          type: NLB
----

. Add `<yourdomain>` to the `domain` parameter in `IngressController` by replacing `<domain>` in `nlb-apps.<domain>.com` with `<yourdomain>`.

. Apply the new `IngressController` by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f ingresscontroller.yaml
----

. Make sure that the value of the `spec.domain` parameter of the new `IngressController` is not in conflict with an existing `IngressController` by completing the following steps:

.. List all `IngressControllers` by running the following command:
+
----
oc get ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator
----

.. Run the following command on each of the `IngressControllers`, except the `ingress-controller-with-nlb` that you just created:
+
----
oc edit ingresscontroller <name> -n openshift-ingress-operator
----
+
If the `spec.domain` report is missing, add a default domain that matches all of the routes that are exposed in the cluster except `nlb-apps.<domain>.com`.
+
If the `spec.domain` report is provided, make sure that the `nlb-apps.<domain>.com` route is excluded from the specified range.

. Run the following command to edit the `assisted-image-service` route to use the `nlb-apps` location:
+
----
oc edit route assisted-image-service -n <namespace>
----
+
The default namespace is where you installed the {mce-short}.

. Add the following lines to the `assisted-image-service` route:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  labels:
    router-type: nlb
  name: assisted-image-service
----

. In the `assisted-image-service` route, find the URL value of `spec.host`. The URL might resemble the following example: 
+
----
assisted-image-service-multicluster-engine.apps.<yourdomain>.com
----

. Replace `apps` in the URL with `nlb-apps` to match the domain configured in the new `IngressController`.

. To verify that the central infrastructure management service is enabled on Amazon Web Services, run the following command to verify that the pods are healthy:
+
----
oc get pods -n multicluster-engine | grep assist
----

. Create a new host inventory and ensure that the download URL uses the new `nlb-apps` URL.
