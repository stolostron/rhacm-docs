[#cluster-lifecycle-arch]
= Cluster lifecycle architecture

Cluster lifecycle requires two types of clusters: _hub clusters_ and _managed clusters_. 

The hub cluster is the {ocp-short} (or {acm-short}) main cluster with the {mce-short} automatically installed. You can create, manage, and monitor other Kubernetes clusters with the hub cluster. You can create clusters by using the hub cluster, while you can also import existing clusters to be managed by the hub cluster.

When you create a managed cluster, the cluster is created using the {ocp} cluster installer with the Hive resource. You can find more information about the process of installing clusters with the {ocp-short} installer by reading link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform_installation/4.14/[Installing and configuring {ocp-short} clusters] in the {ocp-short} documentation.  

The following diagram shows the components that are installed with the {mce} for cluster management:

The components of the cluster lifecycle management architecture include the following items:

[#components-hub-mce]
== Hub cluster

* The _managed cluster import controller_ deploys the klusterlet operator to the managed clusters.
* The _Hive controller_ provisions the clusters that you create by using the {mce}. The Hive Controller also destroys managed clusters that were created by the {mce}.
* The _cluster curator controller_ creates the Ansible jobs as the pre-hook or post-hook to configure the cluster infrastructure environment when creating or upgrading managed clusters.
* When a managed cluster add-on is enabled on the hub cluster, its _add-on hub controller_ is deployed on the hub cluster. The _add-on hub controller_ deploys the _add-on agent_ to the managed clusters.

[#components-managed-mce]
== Managed cluster

* The _klusterlet operator_ deploys the registration and work controllers on the managed cluster.

* The _Registration Agent_ registers the managed cluster and the managed cluster add-ons with the hub cluster. The Registration Agent also maintains the status of the managed cluster and the managed cluster add-ons. The following permissions are automatically created within the Clusterrole to allow the managed cluster to access the hub cluster:

** Allows the agent to get or update its owned cluster that the hub cluster manages

** Allows the agent to update the status of its owned cluster that the hub cluster manages

** Allows the agent to rotate its certificate

** Allows the agent to `get` or `update` the `coordination.k8s.io` lease

** Allows the agent to `get` its managed cluster add-ons

** Allows the agent to update the status of its managed cluster add-ons

* The _work agent_ applies the Add-on Agent to the managed cluster. The permission to allow the managed cluster to access the hub cluster is automatically created within the Clusterrole and allows the agent to send events to the hub cluster.
