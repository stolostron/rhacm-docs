= Destroying a cluster pool

//UI

If you created a cluster pool and determine that you no longer need it, you can destroy the cluster pool.

*Important:* You can only destroy cluster pools that do not have any cluster claims.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

To destroy a cluster pool, complete the following steps: 

. From the navigation menu, click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the _Cluster pools_ tab.

. In the _Options_ menu for the cluster pool that you want to delete, type `confirm` in the confirmation box and select *Destroy*.
+
*Notes:*
+
* The *Destroy* button is disabled if the cluster pool has any cluster claims.
+
* The namespace that contains the cluster pool is not deleted. Deleting the namespace destroys any clusters that have been claimed from the cluster pool, since the cluster claim resources for these clusters are created in the same namespace.

*Tip:* You can destroy multiple cluster pools with one action by selecting the box for each of the cluster pools and using the _Actions_ menu to destroy the selected cluster pools.
