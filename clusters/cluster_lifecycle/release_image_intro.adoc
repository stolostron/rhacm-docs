= Release images

When you create a cluster on a provider by using {mce-short}, you must specify a release image to use for the new cluster. The release image specifies which version of {ocp} is used to build the cluster. By default, the `clusterImageSets` resources are used by {ocp-short} to get the list of supported release images.

The link:https://github.com/stolostron/acm-hive-openshift-releases[acm-hive-openshift-releases GitHub repository] contains the YAML files for the `clusterImageSets` that are supported by {ocp-short}. The contents of this Git repository is organized using a directory structure to separate images based on the {ocp-short} version and the release channel value: `fast`, `stable`, `candidate`. The branches in the Git repository maps to the {ocp-short} release, where each branch contains `clusterImageSets` YAML files that are supported by the corresponding {ocp-short} release.

In {mce-short}, a cluster image set controller that runs on the hub cluster. This controller queries the link:https://github.com/stolostron/acm-hive-openshift-releases[acm-hive-openshift-releases GitHub repository], at set intervals, for new `clusterImageSets` YAML files. By default, the controller synchronizes with the `fast` channel in the `backplane-2.3` branch.

You can configure your `ClusterImageSets` with the following options. 

- *Option 1:* Specify the image reference for the specific `ClusterImageSet` that you want to use in the console when creating a cluster. Each new entry you specify persists and is available for all future cluster provisions. See the following example entry:

----
quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.12.8-x86_64
----

- *Option 2:* Manually create and apply a `ClusterImageSets` YAML file from the `acm-hive-openshift-releases` GitHub repository.

- *Option 3:* Follow the `README.md` in the link:https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-image-set-controller/blob/main/README.md[cluster-image-set-controller GitHub repository] to enable automatic updates of `ClusterImageSets` from a forked GitHub repository.


The cluster image set controller can be configured to use other Git repositories for synchronization of the `ClusterImageSets`. The controller reads the Git repository configuration from the `cluster-image-set-git-repo` ConfigMap in the `multicluster-engine` namespace. You can use this ConfigMap to pause the controller from synchronizing the `ClusterImageSets`. This is achieved by specifying a non-existent/invalid URL in the `gitRepoUrl` field, as shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-image-set-git-repo
  namespace: multicluster-engine
data:
  gitRepoUrl: https://github.com/stolostron/bad-acm-hive-openshift-releases.git
  gitRepoBranch: backplane-2.3
  gitRepoPath: clusterImageSets
  channel: fast

*Note:* Only release images with the label of: `visible: 'true'` are available to select when creating clusters in the console. An example of this label in a `ClusterImageSet` resource is provided in the following content: 

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterImageSet
metadata:
  labels:
    channel: fast
    visible: 'true'
  name: img4.13.8-x86-64-appsub
spec:
  releaseImage: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.12.8-x86_64
----
 
Additional release images are stored, but are not visible in the console. To view all of the available release images, run `kubectl get clusterimageset`.
