= Cluster creation introduction

Learn how to create {ocp} clusters across cloud providers with {mce-short}.

{mce-short} uses the Hive operator that is provided with {ocp-short} to provision clusters for all providers except the on-premises clusters and hosted control planes. When provisioning the on-premises clusters, {mce-short} uses the central infrastructure management and Assisted Installer function that are provided with {ocp-short}. The hosted clusters for hosted control planes are provisioned by using the HyperShift operator.
