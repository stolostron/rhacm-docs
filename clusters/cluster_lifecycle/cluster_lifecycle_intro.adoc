= Cluster lifecycle introduction

The {mce-short} is the cluster lifecycle operator that provides cluster management capabilities for {ocp-short} and {acm-short} hub clusters. The {mce-short} is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management and supports {ocp-short} cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. You can use {mce-short} with or without {acm-short}. {acm-short} also installs {mce-short} automatically and offers further multicluster capabilities.
