= Creating a {sno} cluster

You can create a {sno} cluster that contains only a single node. In a standard cluster, there are control plane nodes and separate worker nodes. This configuration can be helpful when you have many clusters that need to minimize their resource footprint. 

Learn how to deploy a single {sno} cluster. You can also test the procedure of provisioning multiple {sno} clusters on edge resources by using the zero touch provisioning, which is a Technology Preview feature. For more information about that procedure, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/scalability_and_performance/clusters-at-the-network-far-edge[Deploying distributed units at scale in a disconnected environment] in the {ocp-short} documentation. 

*Important:* You should not create a {sno} cluster in production environments.

*Required access*: Administrator

[#sno_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* A supported version of {mce-short} and a hub cluster that is running on a supported {ocp-short} version.
* Credentials to access the provider where you want to create your {sno} cluster. The supported providers include: 
+
** Amazon Web Services
** Microsoft Azure
** Google Cloud Platform
** Red Hat OpenStack Platform
** VMware vSphere

[#sno_create]
== Create a {sno} cluster

To create a {sno} cluster, complete the following steps in the {acm-short} console for creating a cluster on one of the providers that are supported to run a {sno} cluster in xref:../cluster_lifecycle/create_intro.adoc#create-intro[Creating clusters]:

. Select a supported {ocp-short} version in the _Release image_ field. If you enabled the feature, an option to select *{sno}* is displayed. If you select an {ocp-short} version that is earlier than 4.11, the option to select _{sno}_ is not displayed. When you select *{sno}* during the creation process, the _Worker pools_ option is removed from the procedure because there are no worker nodes in a {sno} cluster. 

. Add the `spec:skipMachinePools` parameter in the YAML content with a value of `true` by completing the following steps:

. If you cannot see the YAML content window, set the switch to *YAML:On* to view the content.

. Find the `spec` section for your cluster and add the following flag to the `spec` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
skipMachinePools: true
----

*Important:* When you create a {sno} cluster on GCP, you must configure more CPU and memory resources than for a standard GCP cluster. The minimum requirements for a {sno} cluster on GCP is 8 CPUs and 32 GB of memory. The standard requirements of 4 CPUs and 16 GB of memory is not stable for this type of cluster.
