[#create-a-cluster-cli]
= Creating a cluster with the CLI

The multicluster engine for Kubernetes uses internal Hive components to create {ocp} clusters. See the following information to learn how to create clusters.

* <<create-a-cluster-with-clusterpool,Create a cluster with cluster pool>>

[#create-a-cluster-prereq]
== Prerequisites

Before creating a cluster, you must clone the link:https://github.com/stolostron/acm-hive-openshift-releases/tree/backplane-2.4/clusterImageSets/fast[clusterImageSets] repository and apply it to your hub cluster. See the following steps:

. Run the following command to clone, but replace `2.x` with {mce-version}:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/stolostron/acm-hive-openshift-releases.git
cd acm-hive-openshift-releases
git checkout origin/backplane-<2.x>
----

. Run the following command to apply it to your hub cluster:
+
----
find clusterImageSets/fast -type d -exec oc apply -f {} \; 2> /dev/null
----

Select the {ocp} release images when you create a cluster.

[#create-a-cluster-with-clusterdeployment]
== Create a cluster with ClusterDeployment

A `ClusterDeployment` is a Hive custom resource that is used to control the lifecycle of a cluster.

Follow the link:https://github.com/openshift/hive/blob/master/docs/using-hive.md#using-hive[Using Hive] documentation to create the `ClusterDeployment` custom resource and create an individual cluster.

[#create-a-cluster-with-clusterpool]
== Create a cluster with ClusterPool

A `ClusterPool` is also a Hive custom resource that is used to create multiple clusters. 

Follow the link:https://github.com/openshift/hive/blob/master/docs/clusterpools.md[Cluster Pools] documentation to create a cluster with the Hive `ClusterPool` API.
