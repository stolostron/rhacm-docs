[#importing-managed-cluster-cli]
= Importing a managed cluster by using the CLI

After you install {mce}, you are ready to import a cluster and manage it by using the {ocp} CLI. Continue reading the following topics to learn how to import a managed cluster with the CLI by using the auto import secret, or by using manual commands.

* <<import-cli-prereqs,Prerequisites>>
* <<supported-architectures,Supported architectures>>
* <<preparing-cluster-import,Preparing cluster import>>
* <<importing-clusters-auto-import-secret,Importing a cluster by using the auto import secret>>
* <<importing-cluster-manual,Importing a cluster manually>>
* <<importing-the-klusterlet,Importing the klusterlet add-on>>
* <<removing-imported-cluster-cli,Removing an imported cluster by using the CLI>>

*Important:* A hub cluster cannot manage a different hub cluster. A hub cluster is set up to automatically import and manage itself as a _local cluster_. You do not have to manually import a hub cluster to manage itself. If you remove a hub cluster and try to import it again, you need to add the `local-cluster:true` label.

[#import-cli-prereqs]
== Prerequisites

* A deployed hub cluster. If you are importing bare metal clusters, the hub cluster must be installed on {ocp-short} version 4.12 or later. 
* A separate cluster you want to manage.
* The {ocp-short} CLI version 4.12 or later, to run `oc` commands. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI] for information about installing and configuring the {ocp-short} CLI.
* A defined `multiclusterhub.spec.imagePullSecret` if you are importing a cluster that was not created by {ocp-short}. This secret might have been created when {mce} was installed. See xref:../install_upgrade/adv_config_install.adoc#custom-image-pull-secret[Custom image pull secret] for more information about how to define this secret.

[#supported-architectures]
== Supported architectures

* Linux (x86_64, s390x, ppc64le)
* macOS

[#preparing-cluster-import]
== Preparing for cluster import

Before importing a managed cluster by using the CLI, you must complete the following steps:

. Log in to your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc login
----

. Run the following command on the hub cluster to create the project and namespace. The cluster name that is defined in `<cluster_name>` is also used as the cluster namespace in the YAML file and commands:
+
----
oc new-project <cluster_name>
----
+
*Important:* The `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/managedCluster` label is automatically added to and removed from a managed cluster namespace. Do not manually add it to or remove it from a managed cluster namespace.

. Create a file named `managed-cluster.yaml` with the following example content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name>
  labels:
    cloud: auto-detect
    vendor: auto-detect
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
----
+
When the values for `cloud` and `vendor` are set to `auto-detect`, {product-title-short} detects the cloud and vendor types automatically from the cluster that you are importing. You can optionally replace the values for `auto-detect` with with the cloud and vendor values for your cluster. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
cloud: Amazon
vendor: OpenShift
----

. Apply the YAML file to the `ManagedCluster` resource by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f managed-cluster.yaml
----

You can now continue with either <<importing-clusters-auto-import-secret,Importing the cluster by using the auto import secret>> or <<importing-cluster-manual,Importing the cluster manually>>.

[#importing-clusters-auto-import-secret]
== Importing a cluster by using the auto import secret

To import a managed cluster by using the auto import secret, you must create a secret that contains either a reference to the `kubeconfig` file of the cluster, or the kube API server and token pair of the cluster. Complete the following steps to import a cluster by using the auto import secret:

. Retrieve the `kubeconfig` file, or the kube API server and token, of the managed cluster that you want to import. See the documentation for your Kubernetes cluster to learn where to locate your `kubeconfig` file or your kube API server and token.

. Create the `auto-import-secret.yaml` file in the ${CLUSTER_NAME} namespace.
+
.. Create a YAML file named `auto-import-secret.yaml` by using content that is similar to the following template: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: auto-import-secret
  namespace: <cluster_name>
stringData:
  autoImportRetry: "5"
  # If you are using the kubeconfig file, add the following value for the kubeconfig file
  # that has the current context set to the cluster to import:
  kubeconfig: |- <kubeconfig_file>
  # If you are using the token/server pair, add the following two values instead of
  # the kubeconfig file:
  token: <Token to access the cluster>
  server: <cluster_api_url>
type: Opaque
----

.. Apply the YAML file in the <cluster_name> namespace by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f auto-import-secret.yaml
----
+
*Note:* By default, the auto import secret is used one time and deleted when the import process completes. If you want to keep the auto import secret, add `managedcluster-import-controller.open-cluster-management.io/keeping-auto-import-secret` to the secret. You can add it by running the following command:
+
----
oc -n <cluster_name> annotate secrets auto-import-secret managedcluster-import-controller.open-cluster-management.io/keeping-auto-import-secret=""
----

. Validate the `JOINED` and `AVAILABLE` status for your imported cluster. Run the following command from the hub cluster:
+
----
oc get managedcluster <cluster_name>
----

. Log in to the managed cluster by running the following command on the cluster:
+
----
oc login
----

. You can validate the pod status on the cluster that you are importing by running the following command:
+
----
oc get pod -n open-cluster-management-agent
----

You can now continue with <<importing-the-klusterlet,Importing the klusterlet add-on>>.

[#importing-cluster-manual]
== Importing a cluster manually

*Important:* The import command contains pull secret information that is copied to each of the imported managed clusters. Anyone who can access the imported clusters can also view the pull secret information.

Complete the following steps to import a managed cluster manually:

. Obtain the `klusterlet-crd.yaml` file that was generated by the import controller on your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get secret <cluster_name>-import -n <cluster_name> -o jsonpath={.data.crds\\.yaml} | base64 --decode > klusterlet-crd.yaml
----

. Obtain the `import.yaml` file that was generated by the import controller on your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get secret <cluster_name>-import -n <cluster_name> -o jsonpath={.data.import\\.yaml} | base64 --decode > import.yaml
----
+
Proceed with the following steps in the cluster that you are importing:

. Log in to the managed cluster that you are importing by entering the following command:
+
----
oc login
----

. Apply the `klusterlet-crd.yaml` that you generated in step 1 by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f klusterlet-crd.yaml
----

. Apply the `import.yaml` file that you previously generated by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f import.yaml
----

. You can validate the `JOINED` and `AVAILABLE` status for the managed cluster that you are importing by running the following command from the hub cluster:
+
----
oc get managedcluster <cluster_name>
----

You can now continue with <<importing-the-klusterlet,Importing the klusterlet add-on>>.

[#importing-the-klusterlet]
== Importing the klusterlet add-on

Implement the `KlusterletAddonConfig` klusterlet add-on configuration to enable other add-ons on your managed clusters. Create and apply the configuration file by completing the following steps:

. Create a YAML file that is similar to the following example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: KlusterletAddonConfig
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name>
  namespace: <cluster_name>
spec:
  applicationManager:
    enabled: true
  certPolicyController:
    enabled: true
  iamPolicyController:
    enabled: true
  policyController:
    enabled: true
  searchCollector:
    enabled: true
----

. Save the file as `klusterlet-addon-config.yaml`.

. Apply the YAML by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f klusterlet-addon-config.yaml
----
+
Add-ons are installed after the managed cluster status you are importing is `AVAILABLE`. 

. You can validate the pod status of add-ons on the cluster you are importing by running the following command:
+
----
oc get pod -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

[#removing-imported-cluster-cli]
== Removing an imported cluster by using the command line interface

To remove a managed cluster by using the command line interface, run the following command:

----
oc delete managedcluster <cluster_name>
----

Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of the cluster.
