= Removing a managed cluster from a _ManagedClusterSet_

You might want to remove a managed cluster from a managed cluster set to move it to a different managed cluster set, or remove it from the management settings of the set. You can remove a managed cluster from a managed cluster set by using the console or the CLI.

*Note:* Every managed cluster must be assigned to a managed cluster set. If you remove a managed cluster from a `ManagedClusterSet` and do not assign it to a different `ManagedClusterSet`, the cluster is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

== Removing a cluster from a ManagedClusterSet by using the console

Complete the following steps to remove a cluster from a managed cluster set by using the console:

. Click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters* and ensure that the _Cluster sets_ tab is selected. 

. Select the name of the cluster set that you want to remove from the managed cluster set to view the cluster set details.

. Select *Actions* > *Manage resource assignments*.

. On the _Manage resource assignments_ page, remove the checkbox for the resources that you want to remove from the cluster set. 
+
This step removes a resource that is already a member of the cluster set. You can see if the resource is already a member of a cluster set by viewing the details of the managed cluster.   

*Note:* If you are moving a managed cluster from one managed cluster set to another, you must have the required RBAC permissions on both managed cluster sets.

[#removing-cluster-managedclusterset-cli]
== Removing a cluster from a ManagedClusterSet by using the CLI

To remove a cluster from a managed cluster set by using the command line, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command to display a list of managed clusters in the managed cluster set:
+
----
oc get managedclusters -l cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=<cluster_set>
----
+
Replace `cluster_set` with the name of the managed cluster set.

. Locate the entry for the cluster that you want to remove.

. Remove the label from the YAML entry for the cluster that you want to remove. See the following code for an example of the label:

+
[source,yaml]
----
labels:
   cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: clusterset1
----

*Note:* If you are moving a managed cluster from one cluster set to another, you must have the required RBAC permission on both managed cluster sets.
