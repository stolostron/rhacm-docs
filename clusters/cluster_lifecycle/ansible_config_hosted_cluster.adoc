[#ansible-config-hosted-cluster]
= Configuring {aap-short} jobs to run on hosted clusters

{aap} is integrated with {mce-short} so that you can create prehook and posthook {aap-short} job instances that occur before or after you create or update hosted clusters.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

* <<ansible-hosted-cluster-delete,Running an {aap-short} job to delete a hosted cluster>>

[#prerequisites-for-ansible-integration-hosted-cluster]
== Prerequisites

You must meet the following prerequisites to run Automation templates on your clusters:

* {ocp-short} 4.14 or later

* Install the {aap-short} Resource Operator to connect {aap-short} jobs to the lifecycle of Git subscriptions. When you use the Automation template to start {aap-short} jobs, ensure that the {aap-short} job template is idempotent when it is run. You can find the {aap-short} Resource Operator in the {ocp-short} _OperatorHub_. 

[#ansible-hosted-cluster-install]
== Running an {aap-short} job to install a hosted cluster

To start an {aap-short} job that installs a hosted cluster, complete the following steps:

. Create the `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` resources, including the `pausedUntil: true` field. If you use the `hcp create cluster` command line interface command, you can specify the `--pausedUntil: true` flag.

+
See the following examples:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: HostedCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  namespace: clusters
spec:
  pausedUntil: 'true'
...
----

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-us-east-2
  namespace: clusters
spec:
  pausedUntil: 'true'
...
----

. Create a `ClusterCurator` resource with the same name as the `HostedCluster` resource and in the same namespace as the `HostedCluster` resource. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterCurator
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  namespace: clusters
  labels:
    open-cluster-management: curator
spec:
  desiredCuration: install
  install:
    jobMonitorTimeout: 5
    prehook:
      - name: Demo Job Template
        extra_vars:
          variable1: something-interesting
          variable2: 2
      - name: Demo Job Template
    posthook:
      - name: Demo Job Template
    towerAuthSecret: toweraccess
----

. If your {aap-short} Tower requires authentication, create a secret resource. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: toweraccess
  namespace: clusters
stringData:
  host: https://my-tower-domain.io
  token: ANSIBLE_TOKEN_FOR_admin
----

[#ansible-hosted-cluster-update]
== Running an {aap-short} job to update a hosted cluster

To run an {aap-short} job that updates a hosted cluster, edit the `ClusterCurator` resource of the hosted cluster that you want to update. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterCurator
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  namespace: clusters
  labels:
    open-cluster-management: curator
spec:
  desiredCuration: upgrade
  upgrade:
    desiredUpdate: 4.14.1 <1>
    monitorTimeout: 120
    prehook:
      - name: Demo Job Template
        extra_vars:
          variable1: something-interesting
          variable2: 2
      - name: Demo Job Template
    posthook:
      - name: Demo Job Template
    towerAuthSecret: toweraccess
----

<1> For details about supported versions, see _Hosted control planes_.

*Note:* When you update a hosted cluster in this way, you update both the hosted control plane and the node pools to the same version. Updating the hosted control planes and node pools to different versions is not supported.

[#ansible-hosted-cluster-delete]
== Running an {aap-short} job to delete a hosted cluster

To run an {aap-short} job that deletes a hosted cluster, edit the `ClusterCurator` resource of the hosted cluster that you want to delete. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterCurator
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  namespace: clusters
  labels:
    open-cluster-management: curator
spec:
  desiredCuration: destroy
  destroy:
    jobMonitorTimeout: 5
    prehook:
      - name: Demo Job Template
        extra_vars:
          variable1: something-interesting
          variable2: 2
      - name: Demo Job Template
    posthook:
      - name: Demo Job Template
    towerAuthSecret: toweraccess
----

*Note:* Deleting a hosted cluster on AWS is not supported.
