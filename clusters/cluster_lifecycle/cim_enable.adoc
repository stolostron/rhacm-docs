[#enable-cim]
= Enabling the central infrastructure management service

The central infrastructure management service is provided with the {mce-short} and deploys {ocp-short} clusters. Central infrastructure management is deployed automatically when you enable the MultiClusterHub Operator on the hub cluster, but you have to enable the service manually.

[#enable-cim-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

See the following prerequisites before creating an host inventory:

- You must have a deployed hub cluster on {ocp-short} 4.12 or later with the supported {product-title} version.
- You need internet access for your hub cluster (connected), or a connection to an internal or mirror registry that has a connection to the internet (disconnected) to retrieve the required images for creating the environment.
- You need a bare metal host custom resource definition.
- You need an {ocp-short} link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[pull secret]. See _Using image pull secrets_ for more information. 
- You need a configured default storage class.
- For disconnected environments only, complete the procedure for link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/scalability_and_performance/clusters-at-the-network-far-edge#ztp-acm-preparing-to-install-disconnected-acm_ztp-deploying-disconnected[Clusters at the network far edge] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

[#enable-cim-provision]
== Modifying the _Provisoning_ resource

Modify the `Provisoning` resource if your hub cluster is installed on one of the following platforms:

- Bare metal
- Red Hat OpenStack Platform
- VMware vSphere
- User-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) method and the platform is `None`

If your hub cluster is installed on a different platform, continue at <<enable-cim-disconnected,Enabling central infrastructure management in disconnected environments>> or <<enable-cim-connected,Enabling central infrastructure management in connected environments>>.

Modify the `Provisioning` resource to allow the Bare Metal Operator to watch all namespaces by running the following command:

----
oc patch provisioning provisioning-configuration --type merge -p '{"spec":{"watchAllNamespaces": true }}'
----

[#enable-cim-disconnected]
== Enabling central infrastructure management in disconnected environments

To enable central infrastructure management in disconnected environments, complete the following steps:

. Create a `ConfigMap` in the same namespace as your infrastructure operator to specify the values for `ca-bundle.crt` and `registries.conf` for your mirror registry. Your file `ConfigMap` might resemble the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <mirror-config>
  namespace: "<infrastructure-operator-namespace>"
  labels:
    app: assisted-service
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: |    
    <certificate-content>
  registries.conf: |
    unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]
    [[registry]]
       prefix = ""
       location = "registry.redhat.io/multicluster-engine"
       mirror-by-digest-only = true
       [[registry.mirror]]
       location = "mirror.registry.com:5000/multicluster-engine"
----
+
Registries in the list of `unqualified-search-registries` are automatically added to an authentication ignore list in the `PUBLIC_CONTAINER_REGISTRIES` environment variable. The specified registries do not require authentication when the pull secret of the managed cluster is validated.

. Create the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource by saving the following YAML content in the `agent_service_config.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
 name: agent
spec:
  databaseStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <db_volume_size> 
  filesystemStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <fs_volume_size>
  mirrorRegistryRef:
    name: <mirror_config> <1>
  unauthenticatedRegistries:
    - <unauthenticated_registry> <2>
  imageStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <img_volume_size> <3>
  osImages: 
    - openshiftVersion: "<ocp_version>" <4>
      version: "<ocp_release_version>" <5>
      url: "<iso_url>" <6>
      cpuArchitecture: "x86_64"
----
+
<1> Replace `mirror_config` with the name of the `ConfigMap` that contains your mirror registry configuration details.
+
<2> Include the optional `unauthenticated_registry` parameter if you are using a mirror registry that does not require authentication. Entries on this list are not validated or required to have an entry in the pull secret. 
+
<3> Replace `img_volume_size` with the size of the volume for the `imageStorage` field, for example `10Gi` per operating system image. The minimum value is `10Gi`, but the recommended value is at least `50Gi`. This value specifies how much storage is allocated for the images of the clusters. You need to allow 1 GB of image storage for each instance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS that is running. You might need to use a higher value if there are many clusters and instances of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS.
+
<4> Replace `ocp_version` with the {ocp-short} version to install, for example, `4.13`.
+
<5> Replace `ocp_release_version` with the specific install version, for example, `49.83.202103251640-0`.
+
<6> Replace `iso_url` with the ISO url, for example, `https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/dependencies/rhcos/4.12/4.12.3/rhcos-4.12.3-x86_64-live.x86_64.iso`. You can find other values at the link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/dependencies/rhcos/4.12/4.12.3/[4.12.3 dependencies].

Your central infrastructure management service is configured. You can verify that it is healthy by checking the `assisted-service` and `assisted-image-service` deployments and ensuring that their pods are ready and running.

        storage: <img_volume_size> <3>
----
+
<1> Replace `db_volume_size` with the volume size for the `databaseStorage` field, for example `10Gi`. This value specifies how much storage is allocated for storing files such as database tables and database views for the clusters. The minimum value that is required is `1Gi`. You might need to use a higher value if there are many clusters.
+
<2> Replace `fs_volume_size` with the size of the volume for the `filesystemStorage` field, for example `200M` per cluster and `2-3Gi` per supported {ocp-short} version. The minimum value that is required is `1Gi`, but the recommended value is at least `100Gi`. This value specifies how much storage is allocated for storing logs, manifests, and `kubeconfig` files for the clusters. You might need to use a higher value if there are many clusters.
