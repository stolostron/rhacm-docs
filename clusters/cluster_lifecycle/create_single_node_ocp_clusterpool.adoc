[#creating-a-single-node-openshift-clusterpool]
= Creating a {sno} cluster pool (Technology Preview)

Cluster pools provide rapid and cost-effective access to configured {ocp} clusters on-demand and at scale. Cluster pools maintain a configurable and scalable number of {ocp-short} clusters on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure in a hibernating state that can be claimed when they are needed. They are especially useful when providing or replacing cluster environments for development, continuous integration, and production scenarios.

`ClusterClaim` resources are used to check out clusters from cluster pools. After a cluster is checked out from a cluster pool, the checked out cluster is resumed and brought to a ready state. The cluster pool automatically creates a hibernated cluster in the cluster pool, to replace the claimed one.

*Note:* When a cluster that was claimed from the cluster pool is no longer needed and is destroyed, the resources are deleted. The cluster does not return to the cluster pool.

The procedure for creating a {sno} cluster pool is similar to the procedure for creating a cluster. Clusters in a {sno} cluster pool are not created for immediate use.

*Required access*: Administrator

[#single-node-openshift-pool-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a {sno} cluster pool:

* A deployed {mce-short} hub cluster.
* Internet access for your hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on the provider environment.
* An AWS, GCP, or Microsoft Azure provider credential.
See xref:../credentials/credential_intro.adoc#credentials[Managing credentials overview] for more information.
* A configured domain in your provider environment.
See your provider documentation for instructions about how to configure a domain.
* Provider login credentials.
* A {ocp-short} image pull secret. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets].

* Enable the {sno} feature. Because the {sno} feature is a Technology Preview feature, it is not enabled when you install {acm-short}. You must enable it by completing the following steps:

. Log in to your {acm-short} hub cluster with `administrator` permissions. 

. Enable the feature by entering the following command:
+
----
oc patch configmap console-config -n open-cluster-management --patch '{"data":{"singleNodeOpenshift":"enabled"}}'
----
+
The {sno} feature is now enabled on {acm-short}.

== Create a {sno} cluster pool

To create a cluster pool, complete the following steps:

. From the {mce-short} console navigation menu, click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the _Cluster pools_ tab to view cluster pools that you can access.

. Select *Create cluster pool* and complete the steps in the console to create a cluster pool. 

. Select the infrastructure credential that you want to use for the cluster pool. You can create one by selecting *Add credential*, if it is not available in the list. 

. Add the cluster pool details.
+
.. Enter the namespace where you want to create your cluster pool. You can select an existing namespace from the list, or type the name of a new one to create one. The cluster pool does not have to be in the same namespace as the clusters.
+
When you create a cluster pool in a cluster set, the `namespace admin` permission is applied to all of the users with `clusterset admin` permissions for the namespace where you add the cluster pool. Similarly, the `namespace view` permission is applied to the users with `clusterset view` permissions. 

.. Optional: Select a cluster set name if you want the RBAC roles for your cluster pool to share the role assignments of an existing cluster set. 
+
*Note:* If you do not have `cluster admin` permissions, you must select a cluster set. The request to create a cluster set is rejected with a forbidden error if you do not include the cluster set name in this situation. If no cluster sets are available for you to select, contact your cluster administrator to create a cluster set and give you `clusterset admin` permissions to it.

.. Enter the number of clusters that you want available in your cluster pool by adding the number to the cluster pool size.
  
. Enter the required information in the remaining steps to complete to provision your cluster pool. The procedure from this point on is the same as the procedure for creating clusters. 

. While you create your cluster pool, you must select a supported {ocp-short} version in the _Release image_ field. If you enabled the feature gate, an option to select *Single node OpenShift* is displayed. 
+
*Note:* If you select an {ocp-short} version that is older than 4.9, the option to select _Single node OpenShift_ is not displayed.

. Select *Single node OpenShift*. 

. Add the `spec:skipMachinePools` parameter in the YAML content to `true` by completing the following steps:

.. If you cannot see the YAML content window, set the switch to *YAML:On* to view the content.

.. Find the `spec` section for your cluster and add the following flag to the `spec` section:
+
----
skipMachinePools: true
----
+

. After all of the information is entered, select *Create* to create the cluster pool.
