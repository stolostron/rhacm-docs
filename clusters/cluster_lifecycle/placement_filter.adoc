[#placement-labelselector-claimSelector]
= Filtering _ManagedClusters_ from _ManagedClusterSets_

You can select which `ManagedClusters` to filter by using `labelSelector` or `claimSelector`. See the following examples to learn how to use both filters:

- In the following example, the `labelSelector` only matches clusters with the label `vendor: OpenShift`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  predicates:
    - requiredClusterSelector:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            vendor: OpenShift
----

- In the following example, `claimSelector` only matches clusters with `region.open-cluster-management.io` with `us-west-1`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  predicates:
    - requiredClusterSelector:
        claimSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: region.open-cluster-management.io
              operator: In
              values:
                - us-west-1
----
+
** You can also filter `ManagedClusters` from particular cluster sets by using the `clusterSets` parameter. In the following example, `claimSelector` only matches the cluster sets `clusterset1` and `clusterset2`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  clusterSets:
    - clusterset1
    - clusterset2
  predicates:
    - requiredClusterSelector:
        claimSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: region.open-cluster-management.io
              operator: In
              values:
                - us-west-1
----

You can also choose how many `ManagedClusters` you want to filter by using the `numberOfClusters` parameter. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  numberOfClusters: 3 <1>
  predicates:
    - requiredClusterSelector:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            vendor: OpenShift
        claimSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: region.open-cluster-management.io
              operator: In
              values:
                - us-west-1
----

<1> Specify how many `ManagedClusters` you want to select. The previous example is set to `3`.

[#placement-tolerations]
== Filtering _ManagedClusters_ by defining tolerations with placement

To learn how to filter `ManagedClusters` with matching taints, see the following examples:

- By default, the placement cannot select `cluster1` in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: cluster1
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
  taints:
    - effect: NoSelect
      key: gpu
      value: "true"
      timeAdded: '2022-02-21T08:11:06Z'
----
+
To select `cluster1` you must define tolerations. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: gpu
      value: "true"
      operator: Equal
----

You can also select `ManagedClusters` with matching taints for a specified amount of time by using the `tolerationSeconds` parameter. `tolerationSeconds` defines how long a toleration stays bound to a taint. `tolerationSeconds` can automatically transfer applications that are deployed on a cluster that goes offline to another managed cluster after a specified length of time.

Learn how to use `tolerationSeconds` by viewing the following examples:

- In the following example, the managed cluster becomes unreachable:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: cluster1
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
  taints:
    - effect: NoSelect
      key: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/unreachable
      timeAdded: '2022-02-21T08:11:06Z'
----
+
If you define a placement with `tolerationSeconds`, the workload is transferred to another available managed cluster. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/unreachable
      operator: Exists
      tolerationSeconds: 300 <1>
----
+
<1> Specify after how many seconds you want the workload to be transferred.

[#placement-prioritizerpolicy]
== Prioritizing _ManagedClusters_ by defining _prioritizerPolicy_ with placement

View the following examples to learn how to prioritize `ManagedClusters` by using the `prioritizerPolicy` parameter with placement.

- The following example selects a cluster with the largest allocatable memory:
+
*Note:* Similar to Kubernetes _Node Allocatable_, 'allocatable' is defined as the amount of compute resources that are available for pods on each cluster.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  numberOfClusters: 1
  prioritizerPolicy:
    configurations:
      - scoreCoordinate:
          builtIn: ResourceAllocatableMemory
----

- The following example selects a cluster with the largest allocatable CPU and memory, and makes placement sensitive to resource changes:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  numberOfClusters: 1
  prioritizerPolicy:
    configurations:
      - scoreCoordinate:
          builtIn: ResourceAllocatableCPU
        weight: 2
      - scoreCoordinate:
          builtIn: ResourceAllocatableMemory
        weight: 2
----

- The following example selects two clusters with the largest `addOn` score CPU ratio, and pins the placement decisions:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  numberOfClusters: 2
  prioritizerPolicy:
    mode: Exact
    configurations:
      - scoreCoordinate:
          builtIn: Steady
        weight: 3
      - scoreCoordinate:
          type: AddOn
          addOn:
            resourceName: default
            scoreName: cpuratio
----

[#addon-status]
== Filtering _ManagedClusters_ based on add-on status

You might want to select managed clusters for your placements based on the status of the add-ons that are deployed on them. For example, you can select a managed cluster for your placement only if there is a specific add-on that is enabled on the managed cluster.

You can specify the label for the add-on, as well as its status, when you create the placement. A label is automatically created on a `ManagedCluster` resource if an add-on is enabled on the managed cluster. The label is automatically removed if the add-on is disabled.

Each add-on is represented by a label in the format of `feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-<addon_name>=<status_of_addon>`. 

Replace `addon_name` with the name of the add-on that you want to enable on the selected managed cluster.

Replace `status_of_addon` with the status that you want the add-on to have if the managed cluster is selected.

See the following table of possible value for `status_of_addon`:

|===
| Value | Description

| `available`
| The add-on is enabled and available.

| `unhealthy`
| The add-on is enabled, but the lease is not updated continuously.

| `unreachable`
| The add-on is enabled, but there is no lease found for it. This can also be caused when the managed cluster is offline.
|===

For example, an available `application-manager` add-on is represented by a label on the managed cluster that reads the following:

----
feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-application-manager: available
----

See the following examples to learn how to create placements based on add-ons and their status:

- The following placement example includes all managed clusters that have `application-manager` enabled on them:
