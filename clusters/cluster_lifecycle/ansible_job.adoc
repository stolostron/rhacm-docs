= Creating an Ansible job for a managed cluster

You can create an `AnsibleJob` that is bound to a cluster when the cluster is created or imported to be managed.

Complete the following procedure to create an Ansible job and configure it with a cluster that is not yet managed:

. Create the definition file for the Ansible job in one of the channels that are supported by the application function. Only Git channels are supported.
+
Use `AnsibleJob` as the value of `kind` in the definition.
+
Your definition file contents might resemble the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tower.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AnsibleJob
metadata:
  name: hive-cluster-gitrepo
spec:
  tower_auth_secret: my-toweraccess
  job_template_name: my-tower-template-name
  extra_vars:
    variable1: value1
    variable2: value2
----
+
By storing the file in the prehook or posthook directory, it creates a list of cluster names that match the placement rule. The list of cluster names can be passed as a value of `extra_vars` to the `AnsibleJob` `kind` resource. When this value is passed to the `AnsibleJob` resource, the Ansible job can determine the new cluster name and use it in the automation.

. Log on to your hub cluster.

. Using the console, create an application with a Git subscription that references the channel where you stored the definition file that you just created. See link:../../applications/app_resources.adoc#managing-application-resources[Managing application resources] for more information about creating an application and subscription.
+
When you create the subscription, specify a label that you can add to the cluster that you create or import later to connect this subscription with the cluster. This can be an existing label, like `vendor=OpenShift`, or a unique label that you create and define. 
+
*Note:* If you select any label that is already in use, the Ansible job automatically runs. It is recommended that you include a resource in your application that is not part of the prehooks or posthooks.  
+
The default placement rule runs the job when it detects the cluster with the label that matches the label of the `AnsibleJob`. If you want the automation to run on all of your running clusters that are managed by the hub cluster, add the following content to the placement rule:
+
[source,yaml]
----
clusterConditions:
  - type: ManagedClusterConditionAvailable
    status: "True"
----
+
You can either paste this into the YAML content of the placement rule or you can select the option to _Deploy to all online clusters and local cluster_ on the _Application create_ page of the console. 

. Create or import your cluster by following the instructions in xref:../cluster_lifecycle/create_intro.adoc#create-intro[Creating clusters] or xref:../cluster_lifecycle/import_intro.adoc#import-intro[Cluster import], respectively.
+
When you create or import the cluster, use the same label that you used when you created the subscription, and the `AnsibleJob` is automatically configured to run on the cluster. 
 
The {mce-short} automatically injects the cluster name into the `AnsibleJob.extra_vars.target_clusters` path. You can dynamically inject the cluster name into the definition. Complete the following procedure to create an Ansible job and configure it with a cluster that is already managed:

. Create the definition file for the Ansible job in the prehook or posthook directory of your Git Channel.
+
Use `AnsibleJob` as the value of `kind` in the definition.
+
Your definition file contents might resemble the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tower.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AnsibleJob
metadata:
  name: hive-cluster-gitrepo
spec:
  tower_auth_secret: my-toweraccess
  job_template_name: my-tower-template-name
  extra_vars:
    variable1: value1
    variable2: value2
----
Replace `_my-toweraccess_` with the authentication secret to access your {aap-short}.
Replace `_my-tower-template-name_` with the template name from your {aap-short}.

Each time a cluster that is controlled by the Ansible job is removed or added, the Ansible job automatically runs and updates the `extra_vars.target_clusters` variable. This updating provides the ability to specify cluster names with a specific automation, or apply the automation to a group of clusters.
