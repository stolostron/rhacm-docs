[#assign-role-managedclusterset]
= Assigning RBAC permissions to a _ManagedClusterSet_

You can assign users or groups to your cluster set that are provided by the configured identity providers on the hub cluster.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

See the following table for the three `ManagedClusterSet` API RBAC permission levels:

|===
| Cluster set | Access permissions | Create permissions

| `admin`
| Full access permission to all of the cluster and cluster pool resources that are assigned to the managed cluster set.
| Permission to create clusters, import clusters, and create cluster pools. The permissions must be assigned to the managed cluster set when it is created.

| `bind`
| Permission to bind the cluster set to a namespace by creating a `ManagedClusterSetBinding`. The user or group must also have permission to create the `ManagedClusterSetBinding` in the target namespace. Read only permissions to all of the cluster and cluster pool resources that are assigned to the managed cluster set.
| No permission to create clusters, import clusters, or create cluster pools.

| `view`
| Read only permission to all of the cluster and cluster pool resources that are assigned to the managed cluster set.
| No permission to create clusters, import clusters, or create cluster pools.
|===

*Note:* You cannot apply the Cluster set `admin` permission for the global cluster set.

Complete the following steps to assign users or groups to your managed cluster set from the console:

. From the {ocp-short} console, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the _Cluster sets_ tab.

. Select your target cluster set. 

. Select the _Access management_ tab. 

. Select *Add user or group*.

. Search for, and select the user or group that you want to provide access.

. Select the *Cluster set admin* or *Cluster set view* role to give to the selected user or user group. See _Overview of roles_ in link:../about/mce_rbac.adoc#mce-rbac[{mce-short} Role-based access control] for more information.

. Select *Add* to submit the changes.

Your user or group is displayed in the table. It might take a few seconds for the permission assignments for all of the managed cluster set resources to be propagated to your user or group.

See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/placement_filter.adoc#placement-labelselector-claimSelector[Filtering _ManagedClusters_ from _ManagedCusterSets_] for placement information.
