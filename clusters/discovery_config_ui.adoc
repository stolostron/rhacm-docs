[#discovery-console]
= Configure Discovery with the console

Use the product console to enable Discovery. 

**Required access**: Access to the namespace where the credential was created.

[#discover_ui_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* You need a credential. See link:../credentials/credential_ocm.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-openshift-cluster-manager[Creating a credential for Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager] to connect to {ocm}.

[#discover_ui_enable]
== Configure Discovery 

Configure Discovery in the console to find clusters. You can create multiple `DiscoveryConfig` resources with separate credentials. Follow instructions in the console. 

[#discovery-view]
== View discovered clusters 

After you set up your credentials and discover your clusters for import, you can view them in the console. 

. Click *Clusters* > *Discovered clusters* 
. View the populated table with the following information:
    - _Name_ is the display name that is designated in {ocm}. If the cluster does not have a display name, a generated name based on the cluster console URL is displayed. If the console URL is missing or was modified manually in {ocm}, the cluster external ID is displayed.
    - _Namespace_ is the namespace where you created the credential and discovered clusters.
    - _Type_ is the discovered cluster Red Hat OpenShift type.
    - _Distribution version_ is the discovered cluster Red Hat OpenShift version.
    - _Infrastructure provider_ is the cloud provider of the discovered cluster. 
    - _Last active_ is the last time the discovered cluster was active.
    - _Created_ when the discovered cluster was created.
    - _Discovered_ when the discovered cluster was discovered.
. You can search for any information in the table, as well. For example, to show only _Discovered clusters_ in a particular namespace, search for that namespace.
. You can now click *Import cluster* to create managed clusters. See <<discovery_import,Import discovered clusters>>.

[#discovery_import]
