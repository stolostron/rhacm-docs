= Resizing a cluster (Technology Preview)

You can customize your managed cluster specifications, such as virtual machine sizes and number of nodes. 

Many clusters that are managed by {product-title} can be scaled by using {product-title-short} console or command line, and the `MachinePool` resource. A `MachinePool` resource is a Kubernetes resource on the Hub cluster that groups the `MachineSet` resources together on the managed cluster. The `MachinePool` resource uniformly configures a set of machine resources, including zone configurations, instance type, and root storage. It also helps you manually configure the desired number of nodes or configure auto-scaling of nodes on the managed cluster.
