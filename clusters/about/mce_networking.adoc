[#mce-network-configuration]
= Network configuration

Configure your network settings to allow the connections.

**Important:** The trusted CA bundle is available in the {mce-short} namespace, but that enhancement requires changes to your network. The trusted CA bundle ConfigMap uses the default name of `trusted-ca-bundle`. You can change this name by providing it to the operator in an environment variable named `TRUSTED_CA_BUNDLE`. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy#nw-proxy-configure-object_config-cluster-wide-proxy[Configuring the cluster-wide proxy] in the _Networking_ section of {ocp} for more information.

*Note:* `Registration Agent` and `Work Agent` on the managed cluster do not support proxy settings because they communicate with `apiserver` on the hub cluster by establishing an mTLS connection, which cannot pass through the proxy.

For the {mce-short} cluster networking requirements, see the following table:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound
|
| Kubernetes API server of the provisioned managed cluster
| 6443

| Outbound from the {ocp-short} managed cluster to the hub cluster
| TCP
| Communication between the Ironic Python Agent and the bare metal operator on the hub cluster
| 6180, 6183, 6385, and 5050

| Outbound from the hub cluster to the Ironic Python Agent on the managed cluster
| TCP
| Communication between the bare metal node where the Ironic Python Agent is running and the Ironic conductor service
| 9999

| Outbound and inbound
|
| The `WorkManager` service route on the managed cluster
| 443

| Inbound
|
| The Kubernetes API server of the {mce} cluster from the managed cluster
| 6443

|===

*Note:* The managed cluster must be able to reach the hub cluster control plane node IP addresses.
