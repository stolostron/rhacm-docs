= Requirements and recommendations

Before you install the {mce-short}, review the following system configuration requirements and settings:

* <<supported-browsers-platforms,Supported browsers and platforms>>
* <<network-configuration,Network configuration>>

*Important:* You must install {mce-short} on a cluster that does not have {product-title} earlier than 2.5 installed. If you are using {product-title-short} version 2.5 or later, then multicluster engine for Kubernetes is already installed on the cluster with it.

[#supported-browsers-platforms]
== Supported browsers and platforms 

See important information about supported browsers and features in the https://access.redhat.com/articles/7006302[The multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator 2.3 support matrix].

[#network-configuration]
== Network configuration

**Important:** The trusted CA bundle is available in the {mce-short} namespace, but that enhancement requires changes to your network. The trusted CA bundle ConfigMap uses the default name of `trusted-ca-bundle`. You can change this name by providing it to the operator in an environment variable named `TRUSTED_CA_BUNDLE`. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy#nw-proxy-configure-object_config-cluster-wide-proxy[Configuring the cluster-wide proxy] in the _Networking_ section of {ocp} for more information.

*Note:* `Registration Agent` and `Work Agent` on the managed cluster do not support proxy settings because they communicate with `apiserver` on the hub cluster by establishing an mTLS connection, which cannot pass through the proxy.

Configure your network settings to allow the connections in the following sections:

=== The {mce-short} networking requirements

For the {mce-short} cluster networking requirements, see the following table:

| Direction | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound
| Kubernetes API server of the provisioned managed cluster
| 6443

| Outbound and inbound
| The `WorkManager` service route on the managed cluster
| 443

| Inbound
| The Kubernetes API server of the multicluster engine for Kubernetes cluster from the managed cluster
| 6443
