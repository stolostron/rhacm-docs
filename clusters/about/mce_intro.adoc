= About cluster lifecycle with {mce-short}

The {mce} is the cluster lifecycle operator that provides cluster management capabilities for {ocp} and {product-title-short} hub clusters. If you installed {product-title-short}, you do not need to install {mce-short}, as it is automatically installed.  

See https://access.redhat.com/articles/6973062[The multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator 2.2 support matrix] for support information, as well as the following documentation:

* xref:./requirements.adoc#requirements-and-recommendations[Requirements and recommendations]
* xref:./mce_console.adoc#mce-console-overview[Console overview]
* xref:./rbac_mce.adoc#mce-rbac[{mce} Role-based access control] 

To continue, see the remaining cluster lifecyle documentation at xref:../../clusters/cluster_mce_overview.adoc#cluster_mce_overview[Cluster lifecycle with {mce-short} overview].
