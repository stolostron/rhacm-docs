= Cluster lifecycle with {mce-short} overview

The {mce-short} is the cluster lifecycle operator that provides cluster management capabilities for {ocp-short} and {product-title-short} hub clusters. From the hub cluster, you can create and manage clusters, as well as destroy any clusters that you created. You can also hibernate, resume, and detach clusters. Learn more about the cluster lifecycle capabilities from the following documentation.

Access the link:{support-matrix-mce}[Support matrix] to learn about hub cluster and managed cluster requirements and support.

*Information:*

- Your cluster is created by using the {ocp-short} cluster installer with the Hive resource. You can find more information about the process of installing {ocp-short} clusters at link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/installing/ocp-installation-overview[OpenShift Container Platform installation overview] in the {ocp-short} documentation.  

- With your {ocp-short} cluster, you can use {mce-short} as a standalone cluster manager for cluster lifecycle function, or you can use it as part of a {product-title-short} hub cluster. 

- If you are using {ocp-short} only, the operator is included with subscription. Visit link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/architecture/mce-overview-ocp[About {mce}] from the {ocp-short} documentation.

- If you subscribe to {product-title-short}, you also receive the operator with installation. You can create, manage, and monitor other Kubernetes clusters with the {product-title-short} hub cluster. See the  {product-title-short} link:../install/install_overview.adoc#installing[Installing and upgrading] documentation.

- Release images are the version of {ocp-short} that you use when you create a cluster. For clusters that are created using {product-title-short}, you can enable automatic upgrading of your release images. For more information about release images in {product-title-short}, see xref:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/release_image_intro.adoc#release-images-intro[Release images].
