[#cluster_mce_overview]
= Cluster lifecycle overview

From the hub cluster, you can create and manage clusters, as well as destroy any clusters that you created. You can also hibernate, resume, and detach clusters. 

*Information:*

- Your cluster is created by using the {ocp-short} cluster installer with the Hive resource. You can find more information about the process of installing clusters at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/installing/ocp-installation-overview[OpenShift Container Platform installation overview] in the {ocp-short} documentation.  

- With your {ocp-short} cluster, you can use {mce-short} as a standalone cluster manager for cluster lifecycle function, or you can use it as part of {product-title-short}. 

- If you are using {ocp-short} only, the operator is included with subscription. Learn more https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/architecture/mce-overview-ocp[About multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator] from the {ocp-short} documentation.

- If you subscribe to {product-title-short}, you also receive the operator. The hub cluster is the main cluster with {product-title} installed. You can create, manage, and monitor other Kubernetes clusters with the hub cluster. 

- Release images are the version of {ocp-short} that you use when you create a cluster. For clusters that are created using {product-title-short}, you can enable automatic upgrading of your release images. For more information about release images in {product-title-short}, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/release_images.adoc#release-images[Release images].
