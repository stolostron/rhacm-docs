= Creating a credential

A _credential_ is required to create a {ocp} cluster on a cloud service provider with {product-title}.

The credential stores the access credentials and configuration information for a provider.
Each provider account requires its own credential, as does each domain on a single provider.

The following files detail the information that is required for creating a connection document for each supported provider:
