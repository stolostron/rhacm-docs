= View discovered clusters

After you set up your credentials and discover your clusters for import, you can view them in the console. 

. Click *Cluster* > *Discovered clusters* 
. View the populated table with the following information:
    - _Name_ is the display name that is designated in Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager. If the cluster does not have a display name, a generated name based on the cluster console URL is displayed. If the console URL is missing or was modified manually in Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager, the cluster external ID is displayed.
    - _Status_ is _Active_ or _Stale_. 
    - _Namespace_ is the namespace where you created the credential and discovered clusters.
    - _Distribution version_ is the discovered clusters Red Hat OpenShift version.
    - _Infrastructure provider_ is the cloud provider of the discovered cluster. 
    - _Last active_ is the last time the discovered cluster was active.
    - _Created_ when the discovered cluster was created.
    - _Discovered_ when the discovered cluster was discovered.
. You can search for any information in the table, as well. For example, to show only _Discovered clusters_ in a particular namespace, search for that namespace.
. You can now click *Import cluster* to create managed clusters. See xref:../clusters/discovery_import.adoc#discovery_import[Import discovered clusters].
