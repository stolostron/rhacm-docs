= View discovered clusters (Technology Preview)

After you set up your credentials and discover your clusters for import, you can view them in the console. 

. Click *Cluster* > *Discovered clusters* 
. View the populated table with the following information:
    - _Name_ is the display name that is designated in {ocm}. If the cluster does not have a display name, a generated name based on the cluster console URL is displayed. If the console URL is missing or was modified manually in {ocm}, the cluster external ID is displayed.
    - _Namespace_ is the namespace where you created the credential and discovered clusters.
    - _Type_ is the discovered cluster Red Hat OpenShift type.
    - _Distribution version_ is the discovered cluster Red Hat OpenShift version.
    - _Infrastructure provider_ is the cloud provider of the discovered cluster. 
    - _Last active_ is the last time the discovered cluster was active.
    - _Created_ when the discovered cluster was created.
    - _Discovered_ when the discovered cluster was discovered.
. You can search for any information in the table, as well. For example, to show only _Discovered clusters_ in a particular namespace, search for that namespace.
. You can now click *Import cluster* to create managed clusters. See xref:../clusters/discovery_import.adoc#discovery_import[Import discovered clusters].
