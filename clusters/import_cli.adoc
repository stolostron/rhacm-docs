[#importing-a-managed-cluster-with-the-cli]
= Importing a managed cluster with the CLI

After you install {product-title}, you are ready to import a cluster to manage  by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI. You can import a cluster using the `kubeconfig` file of the cluster that you are importing, or you can run import commands manually on the cluster you are importing. Both procedures are documented.

* <<importing-the-cluster-auto-import-secret,Importing the cluster with the auto import secret>>
* <<importing-the-cluster-manual,Importing the cluster with the manual commands>>
* <<importing-the-klusterlet,Importing the klusterlet>>

*Important:* A hub cluster cannot manage a different hub cluster. A hub cluster is set up to automatically import and manage itself. You do not have to manually import a hub cluster to manage itself. 

However, if you remove a hub cluster and try to import it again, you need to add the `local-cluster:true` label.

[#cli-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* You need a {product-title} hub cluster that is deployed. If you are importing bare metal clusters, you must have the hub cluster installed on {ocp} version 4.6 or later. 
* You need a separate cluster that you want to manage that has Internet connectivity.
* You need the {ocp} CLI version 4.6 or later, to run `oc` commands. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI] for information about installing and configuring the {ocp} CLI, `oc`.
* You need to install the Kubernetes CLI, `kubectl`.
To install `kubectl`, see _Install and Set Up kubectl_ in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[Kubernetes documentation].
+
*Note:* Download the installation file for CLI tools from the console.
* If you are importing a cluster that was not created by {ocp-short}, you need a `multiclusterhub.spec.imagePullSecret` defined. This secret might have been created when {product-title} was installed. See link:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-from-the-operator-hub[Installing from the OperatorHub] for more information about defining the secret. 

[#supported-architecture]
== Supported architectures

[#prepare-for-import]
== Prepare for import

. Log in to your _hub cluster_ by running the following command:
+
----
oc login
----

. Run the following commands on the hub cluster to create the project and namespace:
*Note:* The cluster name that is defined in `CLUSTER_NAME` is also used as the cluster namespace in the YAML file and commands:
+
----
oc new-project ${CLUSTER_NAME}
oc label namespace ${CLUSTER_NAME} cluster.open-cluster-management.io/managedCluster=${CLUSTER_NAME}
----

. Create a file named `managed-cluster.yaml` with the following example content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
  labels:
    cloud: auto-detect
    vendor: auto-detect
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
----
+
When the values for `cloud` and `vendor` are set to `auto-detect`, {product-title-short} detects the cloud and vendor types automatically from the cluster that you are importing. You can optionally replace the values for `auto-detect` with with the cloud and vendor values for your cluster. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
cloud: Amazon
vendor: OpenShift
----

. Apply the YAML file to the `ManagedCluster` resource by entering the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f managed-cluster.yaml
----

[#importing-the-cluster-auto-import-secret]
== Importing the cluster with the auto import secret

To import with the auto import secret, you must create a secret that contains either a reference to the `kubeconfig` file of the cluster or the kube API server and token pair of the cluster. 

. Retrieve the `kubeconfig` file or the kube API server and token of the cluster that you are importing. See the documentation for your Kubernetes cluster to learn where to locate your `kubeconfig` file or your kube API server and token.

. Create the `auto-import-secret.yaml` file in the ${CLUSTER_NAME} namespace.
+
.. Create a YAML file named `auto-import-secret.yaml` that contains content that is similar to the following template: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: auto-import-secret
  namespace: <cluster_name>
stringData:
  autoImportRetry: "5"
  # If you are using the kubeconfig file, add the following value for the kubeconfig file
  # that has the current context set to the cluster to import:
  kubeconfig: |- <kubeconfig_file>
  # If you are using the token/server pair, add the following two values instead of
  # the kubeconfig file:
  token: <Token to access the cluster>
  server: <cluster_api_url>
type: Opaque
----

.. Apply the YAML file in the ${CLUSTER_NAME} namespace with the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f auto-import-secret.yaml
----
+
**Note:** By default, the auto-import secret is used one time and deleted when the import process completes. If you want to keep the auto import secret, add `managedcluster-import-controller.open-cluster-management.io/keeping-auto-import-secret` to the secret. You can add it by running the following command:

+
----
oc -n <cluster_name> annotate secrets auto-import-secret managedcluster-import-controller.open-cluster-management.io/keeping-auto-import-secret=""
----

. Validate the `JOINED` and `AVAILABLE` status for your imported cluster. Run the following command from the hub cluster:
+
----
oc get managedcluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}
----

. Log in to the managed cluster by running the following command on the managed cluster:
+
----
oc login
----

. Run the following command to validate the pod status on the cluster that you are importing:
+
----
oc get pod -n open-cluster-management-agent
----

Continue with <<importing-the-klusterlet,Importing the klusterlet>>.

[#importing-the-cluster-manual]
== Importing the cluster with the manual commands

*Important:* The import command contains pull secret information that is copied to each of the imported clusters. Anyone who can access the imported clusters can also view the pull secret information.

. Obtain the `klusterlet-crd.yaml` file that was generated by the import controller on your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-import -n ${CLUSTER_NAME} -o jsonpath={.data.crds\\.yaml} | base64 --decode > klusterlet-crd.yaml
----

. Obtain the `import.yaml` file that was generated by the import controller on your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-import -n ${CLUSTER_NAME} -o jsonpath={.data.import\\.yaml} | base64 --decode > import.yaml
----
+
Proceed with the following steps in the cluster that you are importing:

. Log in to the managed cluster that you are importing by entering the following command:
+
----
oc login
----

. Apply the `klusterlet-crd.yaml` that you generated in step 1 by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f klusterlet-crd.yaml
----

. Apply the `import.yaml` file that you previously generated by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f import.yaml
----

. Validate `JOINED` and `AVAILABLE` status for the cluster that you are importing. From the hub cluster, run the following command:
+
----
oc get managedcluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}
----

Continue with <<importing-the-klusterlet,Importing the klusterlet>>.

[#importing-the-klusterlet]
== Importing the klusterlet

You can create and apply the klusterlet add-on configuration file by completing the following procedure:

. Create a YAML file that is similar to the following example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: KlusterletAddonConfig
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name>
  namespace: <cluster_name>
spec:
  applicationManager:
    enabled: true
  certPolicyController:
    enabled: true
  iamPolicyController:
    enabled: true
  policyController:
    enabled: true
  searchCollector:
    enabled: true
----

. Save the file as `klusterlet-addon-config.yaml`.

. Apply the YAML by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f klusterlet-addon-config.yaml
----
+
The ManagedCluster-Import-Controller will generate a secret named `+${CLUSTER_NAME}-import+`. The `+${CLUSTER_NAME}-import+` secret contains the `import.yaml` that the user applies to a managed cluster to install klusterlet.
+
Add-ons are installed after the cluster you are importing is `AVAILABLE`. 

. Validate the pod status of add-ons on the cluster you are importing by running the following command:
+
----
oc get pod -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

Your cluster is now imported.

[#removing-imported-cluster-cli]

== Removing an imported cluster with the CLI

To remove a cluster, run the following command:

----
oc delete managedcluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}
----

Replace `cluster_name` with the name of the cluster.

Your cluster is now removed.
