== Observing hosted control planes

After you enable the `multicluster-observability` pod, you can use {product-title-short} Observability Grafana dashboards to view the following information about your hosted control planes:

- *ACM* > *Hosted Control Planes Overview* dashboard to see cluster capacity estimates for hosting hosted control planes, the related cluster resources, and the list and status of existing hosted control planes.

- *ACM* > *Resources* > *Hosted Control Plane* dashboard that you can access from the _Overview_ page to see the resource utilizations of the selected hosted control plane.

To enable, see link:../../observability/observe_environments_intro.adoc#observing-environments-intro[Observability service].
