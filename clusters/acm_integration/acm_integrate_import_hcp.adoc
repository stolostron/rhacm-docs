[#auto-import-hcp]
= Automating import for discovered hosted clusters

Automate the import of hosted clusters by using the `DiscoveredCluster` resource for faster cluster management, without manually importing individual clusters. 

When you automatically import a discovered hosted cluster into {product-title-short}, all {product-title-short} add-ons are enabled so that you can start managing the hosted clusters with the available management tools.

The hosted cluster is also _auto-imported_ into {mce-short}. Through the {mce-short} console, you can manage the hosted cluster lifecycle. However, you cannot manage the hosted cluster lifecycle from the {product-title-short} console.

== Prerequisites

* You need {product-title-short} installed. See the {product-title-short} link:../../install/install_overview.adoc#installing[Installing and upgrading] documentation.

* You need to learn about _Policies_. See the introduction to link:../../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] in the {product-title-short} documentation.

[#config-hcp-autoimport]
== Configuring settings for automatic import

Discovered hosted clusters from managed {mce-short} clusters are represented in `DiscoveredCluster` custom resources, which are located in the managed {mce-short} cluster namespace in {product-title-short}. See the following `DiscoveredCluster` resource and namespace example:

[source,yaml]

----
These discovered hosted clusters are not automatically imported into {product-title-short} until the `spec.importAsManagedCluster` field is set to `true`. Learn how to use a {product-title-short} policy to automatically set this field to `true` for all `type.MultiClusterEngineHCP` within `DiscoveredCluster` resources so that discovered hosted clusters are immediately automatically imported into {product-title-short}.

Configure your Policy to import all your discovered hosted clusters automatically. Log in to your hub cluster from the CLI to complete the following procedure:

. Create aÂ YAML file for your `DiscoveredCluster` custom resource and edit the configuration that is referenced in the following example:

+

      Fine tuning MultiClusterEngineHCP clusters to be automatically imported

<1> To enable automatic import, change the `spec.remediationAction` to `enforce`. 
<2> To enable automatic import, change `spec.importAsManagedCluster` to `true`. 

. Run `oc apply -f <filename>.yaml -n <namespace>` to apply the file.

[#create-hcp-placement]
== Creating the placement definition 

You need to create a placement definition that specifies the managed cluster for the policy deployment. Complete the following procedure:

. Create the `Placement` definition that selects only the `local-cluster`, which is a hub cluster that is managed. Use the following YAML sample:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: policy-mce-hcp-autoimport-placement
  namespace: open-cluster-management-global-set
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/unreachable
      operator: Exists
    - key: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/unavailable
      operator: Exists
  clusterSets:
    - global
  predicates:
    - requiredClusterSelector:
        labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: local-cluster
              operator: In
              values:
                - "true"
----

. Run `oc apply -f placement.yaml -n <namespace>`, where `namespace` matches the namespace that you used for the policy that you previously created. 

[#bind-hcp-placement]
== Binding the import policy to a placement definition

After you create the policy and the placement, you need to connect the two resources. Complete the following steps:

. Connect the resources by using a `PlacementBinding` resource. See the following example where `placementRef` points to the `Placement` that you created, and `subjects` points to the `Policy` that you created:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementBinding
metadata:
  name: policy-mce-hcp-autoimport-placement-binding
  namespace: open-cluster-management-global-set
placementRef:
  name: policy-mce-hcp-autoimport-placement
  apiGroup: cluster.open-cluster-management.io
  kind: Placement
subjects:
  - name: policy-mce-hcp-autoimport
    apiGroup: policy.open-cluster-management.io
    kind: Policy
----

+
. To verify, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get policy policy-mce-hcp-autoimport -n <namespace>
---- 

[#detach-hcp-clusters]
== Detaching hosted clusters from {product-title-short}

You can _detach_ a hosted cluster from {product-title-short} by using the *Detach* option in the {product-title-short} console, or by removing the corresponding `ManagedCluster` custom resource from the command line. 

For best results, detach the managed hosted cluster before _destroying_ the hosted cluster.

When a discovered cluster is detached, the following annotation is added to the `DiscoveredCluster` resource to prevent the policy to import the discovered cluster again.

[source,bash]
----
  annotations:
    discovery.open-cluster-management.io/previously-auto-imported: "true"
----

If you want the detached discovered cluster to be reimported, remove this annotation.
