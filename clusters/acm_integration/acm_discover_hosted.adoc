[#discover-hosted-acm]
= Discovering {mce-short} hosted clusters in {product-title-short}

If you have {mce-short} clusters that are hosting multiple _hosted clusters_, you can bring those hosted clusters to a {product-title-short} hub cluster to manage with {product-title-short} management components, such as _Application lifecycle_ and _Governance_.

You can have those hosted clusters automatically discovered and imported as managed clusters.

*Note:* Since the hosted control planes run on the managed {mce-short} cluster nodes, the number of hosted control planes that the cluster can host is determined by the resource availability of managed {mce-short} cluster nodes, as well as the number of managed {mce-short} clusters. You can add more nodes or managed clusters to host more hosted control planes.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#hosted-acm-prereqs]
== Prerequisites

* You need one or more {mce-short} clusters.

* You need a {product-title-short} cluster set as your hub cluster.

* Install the `clusteradm` CLI by running the following command:

[#hosted-import-config]
== Configuring {product-title-short} to import {mce-short} clusters

{mce-short} has a `local-cluster`, which is a hub cluster that is managed. The following default addons are enabled for this `local-cluster` in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace:

- `cluster-proxy`
- `managed-serviceaccount`
- `work-manager`

[#config-addons-hosted]
=== Configuring add-ons 

When your {mce-short} is imported into {product-title-short}, {product-title-short} enables the same set of add-ons to manage the {mce-short}. 

Install those add-ons in a different {mce-short} namespace so that the {mce-short} can self-manage with the `local-cluster` add-ons while {product-title-short} manages {mce-short} at the same time. Complete the following procedure:

. Log in to your {product-title-short} with the CLI.

. Create the `addonDeploymentConfig` resource to specify a different add-on installation namespace. See the following example where `agentInstallNamespace` points to `open-cluster-management-agent-addons-discovery`:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addons.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: addonDeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: addons-ns-config
  namespace: multicluster-engine
spec:
  agentInstallNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addons-discovery
----

. Run `oc apply -f <filename>.yaml` to apply the file.

. Update the existing `ClusterManagementaddons` resources for the add-ons so that the add-ons are installed in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addons-discovery` namespace that is specified in the `addonDeploymentConfig` resource that you created. See the following example with `open-cluster-management-global-set` as the namespace:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addons.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterManagementaddons
metadata:
  name: work-manager
spec:
  addonsMeta:
    displayName: work-manager
  installStrategy:
    placements:
    - name: global
      namespace: open-cluster-management-global-set
      rolloutStrategy:
        type: All
    type: Placements
----

.. Add the `addonDeploymentConfigs` to the `ClusterManagementaddons`. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addons.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterManagementaddons
metadata:
  name: work-manager
spec:
  addonsMeta:
    displayName: work-manager
  installStrategy:
    placements:
    - name: global
      namespace: open-cluster-management-global-set
      rolloutStrategy:
        type: All
      configs:
      - group: addons.open-cluster-management.io
        name: addons-ns-config
        namespace: multicluster-engine
        resource: addonsdeploymentconfigs
    type: Placements
----

.. Add the `addonDeploymentConfig` to the `managed-serviceaccount`. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addons.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterManagementaddons
metadata:
  name: managed-serviceaccount
spec:

      namespace: open-cluster-management-global-set
      rolloutStrategy:
        type: All
      configs:
      - group: addons.open-cluster-management.io
        name: addons-ns-config
        namespace: multicluster-engine
        resource: addonsdeploymentconfigs
    type: Placements
----

.. Add the `addondeploymentconfigs` value to the `ClusterManagementaddons` resource named, `cluster-proxy`. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addons.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterManagementaddons
metadata:
  name: cluster-proxy
spec:
  addonsMeta:

    placements:
    - name: global
      namespace: open-cluster-management-global-set
      rolloutStrategy:
        type: All
      configs:
      - group: addons.open-cluster-management.io
        name: addons-ns-config
        namespace: multicluster-engine
        resource: addonsdeploymentconfigs
    type: Placements
----

. Run the following command to verify that the add-ons for the {product-title-short} `local-cluster` are re-installed into the namespace that you specified.:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get deployment -n open-cluster-management-agent-addons-discovery
----

+
See the following output example:

+
[source,bash]

[#create-klusterletconfig-mce]
=== Creating a _KlusterletConfig_ resource

{mce-short} has a local-cluster, which is a hub cluster that is managed. A resource named `klusterlet` is created for this local-cluster.

When your {mce-short} is imported into {product-title-short}, {product-title-short} installs the klusterlet with the same name, `klusterlet`, to manage the {mce-short}. This conflicts with the {mce-short} local-cluster klusterlet.

You need to create a `KlusterletConfig` resource that is used by `ManagedCluster` resources to import {mce-short} clusters so that the klusterlet is installed with a different name to avoid the conflict. Complete the following procedure:

. Create a `KlusterletConfig` using the following example. When this `KlusterletConfig` is referenced in a `ManagedCluster`, the value in the `spec.installMode.noOperator.postfix` field is used as a suffix to the klusterlet name, such as `klusterlet-mce-import`:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: KlusterletConfig
apiVersion: config.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: mce-import-klusterlet-config
spec:
  installMode:
    type: noOperator
    noOperator:
       postfix: mce-import
----

. Run `oc apply -f <filename>.yaml` to apply the file.

[#backup-hosted-acm]
=== Configure for backup and restore

Since you installed {product-title-short}, you can also use the _Backup and restore_ feature.

If the hub cluster is restored in a disaster recovery scenario, the imported {mce-short} clusters and hosted clusters are imported to the newer {product-title-short} hub cluster. 

In this scenario, you need to restore the previous configurations as part of {product-title-short} hub cluster restore. 

Add the `backup=true` label to enable backup. See the following steps for each add-on:

* For your `addon-ns-config`, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc label addonsdeploymentconfig addons-ns-config -n multicluster-engine cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup=true
----

* For your `hypershift-addons-deploy-config`, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc label addonsdeploymentconfig hypershift-addons-deploy-config -n multicluster-engine cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup=true
----

* For your `work-manager`, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc label clustermanagementaddons work-manager cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup=true
----

* For your `cluster-proxy `, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc label clustermanagementaddons cluster-proxy cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup=true
----

* For your `managed-serviceaccount`, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc label clustermanagementaddons managed-serviceaccount cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup=true
----

* For your `mce-import-klusterlet-config`, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc label KlusterletConfig mce-import-klusterlet-config cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup=true
----

[#hosted-import-mce]
== Importing {mce-short} manually

. From your {product-title-short} cluster, create a `ManagedCluster` resource manually to import an {mce-short} cluster. See the following file example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  annotations:
    agent.open-cluster-management.io/klusterlet-config: mce-import-klusterlet-config <1>
  name: mce-a <2>
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
  leaseDurationSeconds: 60
----
<1> The `mce-import-klusterlet-config` annotation references the `KlusterletConfig` resource that you created in the previous step to install the {product-title-short} klusterlet with a different name in {mce-short}.
<2> The example imports an {mce-short} managed cluster named `mce-a`.

. Run `oc apply -f <filename>.yaml` to apply the file.

. Create the `auto-import-secret` secret that references the `kubeconfig` of the {mce-short} cluster. Go to xref:../cluster_lifecycle/import_cli.adoc#importing-clusters-auto-import-secret [Importing a cluster by using the auto import secret] to add the auto import secret to complete the {mce-short} auto-import process. 

+
After you create the auto import secret in the {mce-short} managed cluster namespace in the {product-title-short} cluster, the managed cluster is registered.

. Run the following command to get the status:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get managedcluster
----

+
See following example output with the status and example URLs of managed clusters:

+
[source,bash]
----
NAME           HUB ACCEPTED   MANAGED CLUSTER URLS            JOINED   AVAILABLE   AGE
local-cluster  true           https://<api.acm-hub.com:port>  True     True        44h
mce-a          true           https://<api.mce-a.com:port>    True     True        27s
----

*Important:* Do not enable any other {product-title-short} add-ons for the imported {mce-short}.

[#hosted-discover]
== Discovering hosted clusters

After all your {mce-short} clusters are imported into {product-title-short}, you need to enable the hypershift add-on for those managed {mce-short} clusters to discover the hosted clusters.

Default add-ons are installed into a different namespace in the previous procedures. Similarly, you install the `hypershift-addons` into a different namespace in {mce-short} so that the add-ons agent for {mce-short} local-cluster and the agent for {product-title-short} can work in {mce-short}. 

*Important:* For all the following commands, replace `<managed-cluster-names>` with comma-separated managed cluster names for {mce-short}.

. Run the following command to set the `agentInstallNamespace` namespace of the add-on to `open-cluster-management-agent-addons-discovery`:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc patch addonsdeploymentconfig hypershift-addons-deploy-config -n multicluster-engine --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"agentInstallNamespace":"open-cluster-management-agent-addons-discovery"}}'
----

. Run the following command to disable metrics and to disable the hypershift operator management:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc patch addonsdeploymentconfig hypershift-addons-deploy-config -n multicluster-engine --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"customizedVariables":[{"name":"disableMetrics","value": "true"},{"name":"disableHOManagement","value": "true"}]}}'
----

. Run the following command to enable the `hypershift-addon` for {mce-short}:

+
[source,bash]
----
clusteradm addons enable --names hypershift-addon --clusters <managed-cluster-names>
----

. You can get the {mce-short} managed cluster names by running the following command in {product-title-short}.

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get managedcluster
----

. Log into {mce-short} clusters and verify that the hypershift add-on is installed in the namespace that you specified. Run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get deployment -n open-cluster-management-agent-addons-discovery
----
 
See the following example output that lists the add-ons:

+
[source,bash]
----
NAME                                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE

----

{product-title-short} deploys the `hypershift-addon`, which is the discovery agent that discovers hosted clusters from {mce-short}. The agent creates the corresponding `DiscoveredCluster` custom resource in the {mce-short} managed cluster namespace in the {product-title-short} hub cluster when the hosted cluster `kube-apiserver` becomes available. 

You can view your discovered clusters in the console.

. Log into hub cluster console and navigate to *All Clusters* > *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 
. Find the _Discovered clusters_ tab to view all discovered hosted clusters from {mce-short} with type `MultiClusterEngineHCP`. 

Next, visit xref:../acm_integrate_import_hcp.adoc#auto-import-hcp[Automating import for discovered hosted clusters] to learn how to automatically import clusters.
