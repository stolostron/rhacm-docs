= Creating a single node OpenShift cluster (Technology Preview)

You can create a single node OpenShift (SNO) cluster that contains only a single node. In a standard cluster, there are control plane nodes and separate worker nodes. This configuration can be helpful when you have many clusters that need to minimize their resource footprint. 

This procedure explains how to deploy a single SNO cluster. You can also test the procedure of provisioning multiple SNO clusters on edge resources by using the zero touch provisioning, which is a Technology Preview feature. For more information about that procedure, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/scalability_and_performance/ztp-deploying-disconnected[Deploying distributed units at scale in a disconnected environment] in the {ocp-short} documentation. 

*Important:* Creating a SNO cluster should not be used in production environments.

*Required access*: Administrator

[#sno_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* A {product-title} 2.4, or later, hub cluster that is running on {ocp} version 4.9, or later.
* Credentials to access the provider where you want to create your SNO cluster. The supported providers include: 
+
** Amazon Web Services
** Microsoft Azure
** Google Cloud Platform
** Red Hat OpenStack Platform
** VMware vSphere

[#sno_create]
== Create a Single-Node OpenShift cluster

To create a SNO cluster, complete the following steps:

. Enable the SNO feature. Because the SNO feature is a Technology Preview feature, it is not enabled when you install {product-title-short}. You must enable it by completing the following steps:

.. Log in to your {product-title-short} hub cluster with `administrator` permissions. 

.. Enable the feature by entering the following command:
+
----
oc patch configmap console-config -n open-cluster-management --patch '{"data":{"singleNodeOpenshift":"enabled"}}'
----
+
The SNO feature is now enabled on {product-title-short}.

. Complete the steps for creating a cluster on one of the providers that are supported to run a SNO cluster in xref:../clusters/create.adoc#creating-a-cluster[Creating a cluster].

. While you create your cluster, you must select {ocp-short} 4.9, or later In the _Release image_ field. If you enabled the feature, an option to select *Single node OpenShift* is displayed. 
+
*Note:* If you select an {ocp-short} version that is older than 4.9, the option to select _Single node OpenShift_ is not displayed.

. Select *Single node OpenShift*. The _Worker pools_ option is removed from the procedure because there are no worker nodes in a SNO cluster. 

. Add the `spec:skipMachinePools` parameter in the YAML content to `true` by completing the following steps:

.. If you cannot see the YAML content window, set the switch to *YAML:On* to view the content.

.. Find the `spec` section for your cluster and add the following flag to the `spec` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
skipMachinePools: true
----

. Complete the remaining steps of the cluster creation to create your SNO cluster.
+
*Important:* When you create an {ocp-short} SNO cluster on GCP, you must configure more CPU and memory resources than for a standard GCP cluster. The minimum requirements for a SNO cluster on GCP is 8 CPUs and 32 GB of memory. The standard requirements of 4 CPUs and 16 GB of memory is not stable for this type of cluster.
