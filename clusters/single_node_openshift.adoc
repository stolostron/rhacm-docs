= Creating a Single-Node OpenShift cluster (Development Preview)

You can create a Single-Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster that contains only a single node. In a standard cluster, there are master nodes and separate worker nodes. This configuration can be helpful when you have many clusters that need to minimize their resource footprint. 

*Important:* Creating a SNO cluster should not be used in production environments.

*Required access*: Administrator

[#sno_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* A {product-title} {version} 2.3, or later, hub cluster that is running on {ocp} version 4.8, or later.
* Credentials to access the provider where you want to create your SNO cluster. The supported providers include: 
+
** Amazon Web Services
** Microsoft Azure
** Google Cloud Platform
** OpenStack
** VMware vSphere

== Create a Single-Node OpenShift cluster

To create a SNO cluster, complete the following steps:

. Enable the SNO feature. Because the SNO feature is a Development Preview feature, it is not enabled when you install {product-title-short}. You must enable it by completing the following steps:

.. Create a YAML file that contains the following content:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
    name: open-cluster-management-single-node-openshift
    labels:
        console.open-cluster-management.io: ""
spec:
    featureSet: open-cluster-management-single-node-openshift
----

.. Log in to your {product-title-short} hub cluster with `administrator` permissions. 

.. Apply the feature gate by entering the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f <name-of-feature-gate-file>
----
+
Replace `name-of-feature-gate-file` with the name of the file that you created. 
+
The SNO feature is now enabled on {product-title-short}.

. Complete the steps for creating a cluster on one of the supported providers that are supported to run a SNO cluster in xref:../clusters/create.adoc#creating-a-cluster[Creating a cluster].

. While you create your cluster, you must select {ocp-short} 4.8, or later In the _Release image_ field. If you enabled the feature gate, an option to select *Single node OpenShift* is displayed. 
+
*Note:* If you select an {ocp-short} version that is older than 4.8, the option to select _Single node OpenShift_ is not displayed.

. Select *Single node OpenShift*. The _Worker pools_ option is removed from the procedure because there are no worker nodes in a SNO cluster. 

. Add the `spec:skipMachinePools` parameter in the YAML content to `true` by completing the following steps:

.. If you cannot see the YAML content window, set the switch to *YAML:On* to view the content.

.. Find the `spec` section for your cluster and add the following flag to the `spec` section:
+
----
skipMachinePools: true
----

. Complete the remaining steps of the cluster creation to create your SNO cluster. There is a known issue when you create a cluster pool with a SNO cluster, the cluster pools with the SNO enabled clusters are provisioning worker nodes. SNO clusters should not have worker nodes. You can remove the worker nodes by deleting the `MachinePool` custom resource from the claimed managed SNO cluster.
+
*Important:* When you create an {ocp-short} SNO cluster on GCP, you must configure more CPU and memory resources than for a standard GCP cluster. The minimum requirements for a SNO cluster on GCP is 8 CPUs and 32 GB of memory. The standard requirements of 4 CPUs and 16 GB of memory is not stable for this type of cluster.
