[#creating-a-cluster-on-vmware-vsphere]
= Creating a cluster on VMware vSphere

You can use the {product-title} console to deploy a {ocp} cluster on VMware vSphere.

When you create a cluster, the creation process uses the {ocp-short} installer with the Hive resource. If you have questions about cluster creation after completing this procedure, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/installing/installing-on-vsphere[Installing on vSphere] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information about the process.

[#vsphere_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a cluster on vSphere:

* A {product-title-short} hub cluster that is deployed on {ocp-short} version 4.6 or later.
* Internet access for your {product-title-short} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on vSphere.
* vSphere credential. See link:../credentials/credential_vm.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-vmware-vsphere[Creating a credential for VMware vSphere] for more information.
* An {ocp-short} image pull secret. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets].
* The following information for the VMware instance where you are deploying:
** Required static IP addresses for API and Ingress instances.
** DNS records for:
*** `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` which must point to the static API VIP.
*** `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` which must point to the static IP address for Ingress VIP.

== Creating your cluster with the console

To create clusters from the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*, and click *Create cluster* on the _Clusters_ page. Complete the steps in the console.
+
*Note:* This procedure is for creating a cluster.
If you have an existing cluster that you want to import, see xref:../clusters/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster] for those steps.

. Select your infrastructure provider credential from the available credentials on the list. If you do not have one configured, or if you want to configure a new one, select *Add credential*. See link:../credentials/credential_vm.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-vmware-vsphere[Creating a credential for VMware vSphere] for more information about creating a credential.

. Add the name and details for your cluster. The name is used in the hostname of the cluster. 
+
*Tip:* You can view the `yaml` content updates as you enter the information in the console by setting the _YAML_ switch to *ON*.

.. Specify a _Cluster set_, if you want to add it to an existing cluster set. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges when you are creating the cluster, you must select a cluster set on which you have `clusterset-admin` permissions to create the cluster. If you do not select a cluster set, the cluster creation fails. Contact your cluster administrator to provide you with `clusterset-admin` permissions to a cluster set if you do not have cluster set options to select.
+
Every managed cluster must be associated with a managed cluster set. If you do not assign the managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

.. Specify the _Base DNS domain_ information that you configured for your VMware vSphere account. This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section. This name is used in the hostname of the cluster. If there is already a base domain associated with the selected credential, that value is populated in that field. You can change the value by overwriting it.
+
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/installing/installing-on-aws#installing-aws-account[Configuring an AWS account] for more information.

.. Specify a _Release image_ that you want to use for the cluster. This identifies the version of the {ocp-short} image that is used to create the cluster. If the version that you want to use is available, you can select the image from the list of images. If the image that you want to use is not a standard image, you can enter the URL to the image that you want to use. See xref:../clusters/release_images.adoc#release-images[Release images] for more information about release images.
+
*Note:* Only release images for {ocp-short} versions 4.5.x and higher are supported.

.. Add any _Additional Labels_ that you want to associate with your cluster. These labels help to identify the cluster and limit search results.

. Enter details about the Node pools, including the control plane pool and the worker pools. The control plane nodes share the management of the cluster activity. The optional information includes the following fields:
+
.. Specify one or more _Cores per socket_ that you want to allocate for your cluster.

.. Specify a number of _CPUs_ to allocate for your control plane node.
 
.. Specify the amount of _Memory_, in MB, that you want to allocate.

.. Add the _Disk size_ that you want to create for your control plane node. 

. Enter details about your worker pools. You can create zero or more worker nodes in a worker pool to run the container workloads for the cluster. They can be in a single worker pool, or distributed across multiple worker pools. If zero worker nodes are specified, the control plane nodes also function as worker nodes. The information includes the following fields:
+
.. Add a name for your worker pool.

.. Specify one or more _Cores per socket_ that you want to allocate for your cluster. 

.. Specify a number of _CPUs_ to allocate. 

.. Specify the amount of _Memory_, in MB, that you want to allocate.

.. Add the _Disk size_, in GiB, that you want to create.

.. Add a _Node count_ to specify the number of worker nodes in your cluster.
+
You can define additional worker pools by clicking *Add worker pool*.

. Configure the cluster networking options. This information is required. Multiple networks are required for using IPv6.
+
.. vSphere network name - The VMware vSphere network name.

.. API VIP - The IP address to use for internal API communication.
+
*Note:* This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section. If not provided, the DNS must be pre-configured so that `api.` resolves correctly.

.. Ingress VIP - The IP address to use for ingress traffic. 
+
*Note:* This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section. If not provided, the DNS must be pre-configured so that `test.apps.` resolves correctly.
+
You can add an additional network by clicking *Add network*. You must have more than one network if you are using IPv6 addresses. 

. Add your proxy information, if you want to enable a proxy. Proxy information that is provided in the credential is automatically added.

. Add an optional _Ansible Automation Template_ to run either before or after your cluster installs or upgrades.
+
You can click *Add automation template* to create a template. 
 
. Review your information and optionally customize it.
.. Click the *YAML* slider to *On* to view the `install-config.yaml` file content in the panel. 
.. Edit the YAML file with your custom settings. 

. Select *Create* to create the cluster.  
+
*Note:* You do not have to run the `kubectl` command that is provided with the cluster details to import the cluster. When you create the cluster, it is automatically configured under the management of {product-title-short}.

Your cluster is created. Continue with link:../clusters/access_cluster.adoc#accessing-your-cluster[Accessing your cluster] for instructions for accessing your cluster.
