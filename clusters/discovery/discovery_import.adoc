[#import-discovered-auto-rosa]
= Import Discovered clusters automatically for ROSA clusters

Automatically import ROSA clsuters into your {product-title} hub cluster with the `discovery-operator`.

== Prerequisites

* You must access the cluster as the cluster administrator.
* You must have access to the namespaces that were used to configure Discovery.
* You must have permission to import your cluster to enable automatic import.

To automatically import the `DiscoveredCluster` resource, you must modify the resource and set the `importAsManagedCluster` field to `true`. 

. Log in to your hub cluster from the console.
. Select *Search* from the navigation menu. 
. From the search bar, enter the following query: `DiscoveredCluster`
. The `DiscoveredCluster` resource results appears.
. Go to the `DiscoveredCluster` resource and set `importAsManagedCluster` to `true`. By setting the field to `true`, the `discovery-operator` imports the `DiscoveredCluster` resource, and creates a `ManagedCluster`, `KlusterletAddOnConfig`, (only if {product-title-short} is installed) and automatically imports `Secret` resources for your cluster.

Your `DiscoveredCluster` resource might resemble the following instance:
