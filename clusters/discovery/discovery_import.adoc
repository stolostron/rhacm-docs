== Import Discovered clusters 

When you configure the Discovery feature on your cluster, you must enable a `DiscoveryConfig` resource to connect to the OpenShift Cluster Manager to begin discovering clusters that are a part of your organization. After you discover clusters, you can import clusters that appear in the _Discovered clusters_ tab of the console. 

[#import-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You need access to the namespaces that were used to configure Discovery.

[#import-discovered]
== Import Discovered clusters from the console

. Navigate to the existing _Clusters_ page and click on the _Discovered clusters_ tab.
. From the _Discovered clusters_  table, find the cluster that you want to import. 
. From the options menu, choose *Import cluster*. 
. For discovered clusters, you can import manually using the documentation, or you can choose Import clusters automatically.
. To import automatically with your credentials or Kubeconfig file, copy and paste the content.
. Click *Import*.

[#import-discovered-auto]
== Import Discovered clusters automatically

To automatically import the `DiscoveredCluster` resource, you must modify the resource and set the `importAsManagedCluster` field to `true`. By setting the field to `true`, the Discovery operator imports the `DiscoveredCluster` resource, and creates a `ManagedCluster`, `KlusterletAddOnConfig`, (only if {product-title-short} is installed) and automatically imports `Secret` resources for your cluster.

Your `DiscoveredCluster` resource might resemble the following instance:
