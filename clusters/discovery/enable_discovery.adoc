[#enable-discovered]
= Enabling a discovered cluster for management

Automatically import supported clusters into your hub cluster with the `Discovery-Operator` for faster cluster management, without manually importing individual clusters.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[discovered-rosa-prereqs]
== Prerequisites

* Discovery is enabled by default. If you changed default settings, you need to enable Discovery.
* You must set up the {rosa} command line interface. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/rosa_cli/rosa-get-started-cli#rosa-get-started-cli[Getting started with the {rosa} CLI] documentation.

[#import-discovered-auto-rosa-hcp]
== Importing discovered {rosa} and hosted control plane clusters automatically  

The following procedure is an example of how to import your discovered {rosa} and hosted control planes clusters automatically by using the `Discovery-Operator`.

[#import-discovered-rosa-console]
=== Importing from the console

To automatically import the `DiscoveredCluster` resource, you must modify the resource and set the `importAsManagedCluster` field to `true` in the console. See the following procedure:

. Log in to your hub cluster from the console.
. Select *Search* from the navigation menu. 
. From the search bar, enter the following query: "DiscoveredCluster".
. The `DiscoveredCluster` resource results appear.
. Go to the `DiscoveredCluster` resource and set `importAsManagedCluster` to `true`. See the following example, where `importAsManagedCluster` is set to `true` and `<4.x.z>` is your supported {ocp-short} version:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: discovery.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: DiscoveredCluster
metadata:
  name: 28c17977-fc73-4050-b5cc-a5aa2d1d6892
  namespace: discovery
spec:
  openshiftVersion: <4.x.z>
  isManagedCluster: false
  cloudProvider: aws   
  name: 28c17977-fc73-4050-b5cc-a5aa2d1d6892   
  displayName: rosa-dc
  status: Active
  importAsManagedCluster: true <1>
  type: <supported-type> <2>
----
<1> By setting the field to `true`, the `Discovery-Operator` imports the `DiscoveredCluster` resource, creates a `ManagedCluster` resource and if the {acm-short} is installed, creates the `KlusterletAddOnConfig` resource. It also creates the `Secret` resources for your automatic import.
<2> You must use `ROSA` or `MultiClusterEngineHCP` as the parameter value.

. To verify that the `DiscoveredCluster` resource is imported, go to the *Clusters* page. Check the import status of your cluster from the _Cluster list_ tab.
. If you want to detach managed clusters for Discovery to prevent automatic reimport, select the *Detach cluster* option. The `Discovery-Operator` adds the following annotation, `discovery.open-cluster-management.io/previously-auto-imported: 'true'`.
+
Your `DiscoveredCluster` resource might resemble the following YAML:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: discovery.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: DiscoveredCluster
metadata:
  annotations:
    discovery.open-cluster-management.io/previously-auto-imported: 'true'
----

. To verify that the `DiscoveredCluster` resource is not reimported automatically, check for the following message in the `Discovery-Operator` logs, where `"rosa-dc"` is this discovered cluster:

+
[source,bash]
----
2024-06-12T14:11:43.366Z INFO reconcile	Skipped automatic import for DiscoveredCluster due to 
existing 'discovery.open-cluster-management.io/previously-auto-imported' annotation {"Name": "rosa-dc"}
----

. If you want to reimport the `DiscoveredCluster` resource automatically, you must remove the previously mentioned annotation.

[#import-discovered-rosa-cli]
=== Importing from the command line interface

To automatically import the `DiscoveredCluster` resource from the command line complete the following steps:

. To automatically import the `DiscoveredCluster` resource, set the `importAsManagedCluster` paramater to `true` by using the following command after you log in. Replace `<name>` and `<namespace>` with your name and namespace:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc patch discoveredcluster <name> -n <namespace> --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/importAsManagedCluster", "value": true}]'
----

. Run the following command to verify that the cluster was imported as a managed cluster:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get managedcluster <name>
----

. To get a description of your {rosa} cluster ID, run the following command from the {rosa} command line interface:

+
[source,bash]
----
rosa describe cluster --cluster=<cluster-name> | grep -o '^ID:.*
----

For other Kubernetes providers, you must import these infrastructure provider `DiscoveredCluster` resources manually. Directly apply Kubernetes configurations to the other types of `DiscoveredCluster` resources. If you enable the `importAsManagedCluster` field from the `DiscoveredCluster` resource, it is not imported due to the Discovery webhook.
