//since I mention ACM, should this be added to the new acm_integration folder instead? | MJ | 07/02

Automatically import {rosa} clusters into your hub cluster with the `discovery-operator` for faster cluster management, without manually importing individual clusters.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

=== Prerequisites

* You must have access to the namespaces that were used to configure the discovery service.

Review the following sections to learn more about importing and managing discovered clusters:

* <<import-discovered-auto-rosa,Importing discovered clusters automatically for {rosa} clusters>>
* <<detach-managed-cluster,Detaching managed clusters for Discovery>>
* <<import-non-rosa-clusters,Importing non-{rosa} clusters automatically>>

[#import-discovered-auto-rosa]
== Importing discovered {rosa} clusters automatically  

The following procedure is an example of how to import your discovered {rosa} clusters automatically by using the `discovery-operator`.

[#import-discovered-rosa-console]
=== Importing from the console

To automatically import the `DiscoveredCluster` resource, you must modify the resource and set the `importAsManagedCluster` field to `true` in the console. See the following procedure:

. Log in to your hub cluster from the console.
. Select *Search* from the navigation menu. 
. From the search bar, enter the following query: "DiscoveredCluster".
. The `DiscoveredCluster` resource results appear.
//need to follow up on this
. Go to the `DiscoveredCluster` resource and set `importAsManagedCluster` to `true`. 
+
*Note:* By setting the field to `true`, the `discovery-operator` imports the `DiscoveredCluster` resource, creates a `ManagedCluster` resource and if the {product-title-short} is installed, creates the `KlusterletAddOnConfig` resource. It also creates the `Secret` resources for your automatic import. See, the following example, where `importAsManagedCluster` is set to `true` and `4.x.x` is your supported {ocp-short} version:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: discovery.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: DiscoveredCluster
metadata:
  name: 28c17977-fc73-4050-b5cc-a5aa2d1d6892
  namespace: discovery
spec:
  openshiftVersion: 4.x.x
  isManagedCluster: false
  cloudProvider: aws   
  name: 28c17977-fc73-4050-b5cc-a5aa2d1d6892   
  displayName: rosa-dc
  status: Active
  importAsManagedCluster: true
  type: ROSA
----

. To verify that the `DiscoveredCluster` resource is imported, go to the *Clusters* page. Check the import status of your cluster from the _Cluster list_ tab.
. If you want to detach managed clusters for Discovery to prevent automatic reimport, select the *Detach cluster* option. The `discovery-operator` adds the following annotation, `discovery.open-cluster-management.io/previously-auto-imported: 'true'`.
+
Your `DiscoveredCluster` resource might resemble the following YAML:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: discovery.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: DiscoveredCluster
metadata:
  annotations:
    discovery.open-cluster-management.io/previously-auto-imported: 'true'
----

. To verify that the `DiscoveredCluster` resource is not reimported automatically, check for the following message in the `DiscoveredCluster` logs:

+
[source,bash]
----
2024-06-12T14:11:43.366Z INFO reconcile	Skipped automatic import for DiscoveredCluster due to 
existing 'discovery.open-cluster-management.io/previously-auto-imported' annotation {"Name": "rosa-dc"}
----

. If you want to reimport the `DiscoveredCluster` resource automatically, you must remove the previously mentioned annotation.

[import-discovered-rosa-cli]
=== Importing from the command line interface

. To automatically import the `DiscoveredCluster` resource from the command line, run the following command after you log in. Replace `<name>` and `<namespace>` with your name and namespace:

[source,bash]
----
oc patch discoveredcluster <name> -n <namespace> --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/importAsManagedCluster", "value": true}]'
----

. Run the following command to verify that the cluster was imported as a managed cluster:

[source,bash]
----
oc get managedcluster <name>
----

You can also automatically import MCE HCP with the previous steps

You must import these infrastructure provider `DiscoveredCluster` resources manually. You must directly apply Kubernetes configurations to the other types of `DiscoveredCluster` resources. If you enable the `importAsManagedCluster` field from the `DiscoveredCluster` resource, it is not imported due to the Discovery webhook. See, link:../discovery/config_ui.adoc#import-discovered[Import discovered clusters from the console].

//*Note:* If there is a `MultiClusterEngineHCP` type for the `DiscoveredCluster` resource you can automatically import it. However, the `DiscoveredCluster` resource is provided through only HyperShift. For more details see,
