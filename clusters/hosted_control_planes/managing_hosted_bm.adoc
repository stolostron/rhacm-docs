[#hosted-control-planes-manage-bm]
= Managing hosted control plane clusters on bare metal

You can use the {mce-short} console or the hosted control plane command line interface (`hcp`) to create an {ocp-short} hosted cluster. The hosted cluster is automatically imported as a managed cluster. If you want to disable this automatic import feature, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted_disable_auto_import.adoc#hosted-disable-auto-import[Disabling the automatic import of hosted clusters into {mce-short}].

*Note:* Each hosted cluster must have a unique name in order for {mce-short} to manage it.

[#hosted-prerequisites-bm]
== Prerequisites

You must configure hosted control planes for bare metal before you can create hosted control plane clusters. See xref:../../clusters/hosted_control_planes/configure_hosted_bm.adoc#configuring-hosting-service-cluster-configure-bm[Configuring the hosting cluster on bare metal] for more information.
