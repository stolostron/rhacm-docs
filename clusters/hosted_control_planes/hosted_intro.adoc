[#hosted-control-planes-intro]
= Hosted control planes

With {mce-short} cluster management, you can deploy {ocp-short} clusters by using two different control plane configurations: standalone or hosted control planes. The standalone configuration uses dedicated virtual machines or physical machines to host the {ocp-short} control plane. With hosted control planes for {ocp-short}, you create control planes as pods on a hosting cluster without the need for dedicated physical machines for each control plane.

Hosted control planes for {ocp-short} is available on Amazon Web Services (AWS), {ocp-virt}, and bare metal. In addition, hosted control planes is available as a Technology Preview feature on IBM Power, IBM Z, and non bare metal agent machines. The hosted control planes feature is enabled by default.

Hosted control plane clusters offer several advantages:

* Save cost by removing the need to host dedicated control plane nodes

* Introduce separation between the control plane and the workloads, which improves isolation and reduces configuration errors that can require changes

* Decrease the cluster creation time by removing the requirement for control plane node bootstrapping

* Support turn-key deployments or fully customized {ocp-short} provisioning

[#hosted-control-requirements]
== Requirements

The hosting cluster and workers must run on the same infrastructure. For example, you cannot run your hosting cluster on bare metal and your workers on the cloud. However, the hub cluster and workers do not need to run on the same platform. For example, you might run your hosting cluster on bare metal and workers on OpenShift Virtualization.

The control plane is associated with a hosted cluster and runs as pods in a single namespace. When the cluster service consumer creates a hosted cluster, it creates a worker node that is independent of the control plane.

The following table indicates which {ocp-short} versions are supported for each platform. In the table, _Hosting {ocp-short} version_ refers to the {ocp-short} version where {mce-short} is enabled:

|===
| Platform | Hosting {ocp-short} version | Hosted {ocp-short} version
| AWS | 4.11 - 4.16 | 4.14 - 4.16 (only)
| IBM Power | 4.16 | 4.16 (only)
| IBM Z | 4.16 | 4.16 (only)
| {ocp-virt} | 4.14 - 4.16 | 4.14 - 4.16 (only)
| Bare metal | 4.14 - 4.16 | 4.14 - 4.16 (only)
| Non bare metal agent machines | 4.16 | 4.16 (only)
