= Hosted control planes

With {mce-short} cluster management, you can deploy {ocp-short} clusters by using two different control plane configurations: standalone or hosted control planes. The standalone configuration uses dedicated virtual machines or physical machines to host the {ocp-short} control plane. With hosted control planes for {ocp-short}, you create control planes as pods on a hosting cluster without the need for dedicated physical machines for each control plane.

Hosted control planes for {ocp-short} are available on bare metal and {ocp-virt}, and as a Technology Preview feature on Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can host the control planes on {ocp-short} version 4.14. The hosted control planes feature is enabled by default.

The following table indicates which {ocp-short} versions are supported for each platform. In the table, _Hosting {ocp-short} version_ refers to the {ocp-short} version where {mce-short} is enabled:

|===
| Platform | Hosting {ocp-short} version | Minimum hosted {ocp-short} version
| Bare metal | 4.14 | 4.14
| {ocp-virt} | 4.14 | 4.14
| AWS (Technology Preview) | 4.11 - 4.14 | 4.14
|===

**Note:** Run the hub cluster and workers on the same platform for hosted control planes.

The control plane runs as pods that are contained in a single namespace and is associated with the hosted control plane cluster. When {ocp-short} creates this type of hosted cluster, it creates a worker node that is independent of the control plane. 

Hosted control plane clusters offer several advantages:

* Saves cost by removing the need to host dedicated control plane nodes

* Introduces separation between the control plane and the workloads, which improves isolation and reduces configuration errors that can require changes

* Decreases the cluster creation time by removing the requirement for control plane node bootstrapping

* Supports turn-key deployments or fully customized {ocp-short} provisioning
