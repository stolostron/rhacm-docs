[#hosted-cluster-workload-distributing]
= Distributing hosted cluster workloads

Before you get started with hosted control planes for {ocp-short}, you must properly label nodes so that the pods of hosted clusters can be scheduled into infrastructure nodes. Node labeling is also important for the following reasons:

* To ensure high availability and proper workload deployment. For example, you can set the `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` label to avoid having the control-plane workload count toward your {ocp-short} subscription.
* To ensure that control plane workloads are separate from other workloads in the management cluster.
//lahinson - sept. 2023 - commenting out the following lines until those levels are supported for self-managed hypershift
//* To ensure that control plane workloads are configured at one of the following multi-tenancy distribution levels:
//** Everything shared: Control planes for hosted clusters can run on any node that is designated for control planes.
//** Request serving isolation: Serving pods are requested in their own dedicated nodes.
//** Nothing shared: Every control plane has its own dedicated nodes. 

*Important:* Do not use the management cluster for your workload. Workloads must not run on nodes where control planes run.

[#hosted-cluster-labels-taints-overview]
== Labels and taints for management cluster nodes

As a management cluster administrator, use the following labels and taints in management cluster nodes to schedule a control plane workload:

* `hypershift.openshift.io/control-plane: true`: Use this label and taint to dedicate a node to running hosted control plane workloads. By setting a value of `true`, you avoid sharing the control plane nodes with other components, for example, the infrastructure components of the management cluster or any other mistakenly deployed workload.
* `hypershift.openshift.io/cluster: ${HostedControlPlane Namespace}`: Use this label and taint when you want to dedicate a node to a single hosted cluster.

Apply the following labels on the nodes that host control-plane pods:

* `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`: Use this label to avoid having the control-plane workload count toward your subscription.
* `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`: Use this label on the management cluster nodes to deploy highly available clusters across failure domains. The zone might be a location, rack name, or the hostname of the node where the zone is set. For example, a management cluster has the following nodes: `worker-1a`, `worker-1b`, `worker-2a`, and `worker-2b`. The `worker-1a` and `worker-1b` nodes are in `rack1`, and the `worker-2a` and worker-2b nodes are in `rack2`. To use each rack as an availability zone, enter the following commands:

+
----
oc label node/worker-1a node/worker-1b topology.kubernetes.io/zone=rack1
oc label node/worker-2a node/worker-2b topology.kubernetes.io/zone=rack2
----

Pods for a hosted cluster have tolerations, and the scheduler uses affinity rules to schedule them. Pods tolerate taints for `control-plane` and the `cluster` for the pods. The scheduler prioritizes the scheduling of pods into nodes that are labeled with `hypershift.openshift.io/control-plane` and `hypershift.openshift.io/cluster: ${HostedControlPlane Namespace}`.

For the `ControllerAvailabilityPolicy` option, use `HighlyAvailable`, which is the default value that the hosted control planes command line interface, `hcp`, deploys. When you use that option, you can schedule pods for each deployment within a hosted cluster across different failure domains by setting `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` as the topology key. Control planes that are not highly available are not supported.

*Important:* Proper node labeling, which is detailed in the following procedure, is a prerequisite to deploying hosted control planes.

[#hosted-cluster-schedule-pods-infra-nodes]
== Labeling nodes for hosted clusters

To enable a hosted cluster to require its pods to be scheduled into infrastructure nodes, set `HostedCluster.spec.nodeSelector`, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
    nodeSelector:
      role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
----

This way, hosted control planes for each hosted cluster are eligible infrastructure node workloads, and you do not need to entitle the underlying {ocp-short} nodes.

[#hosted-cluster-workload-distributing-priority]
== Priority classes

Four built-in priority classes influence the priority and preemption of the hosted cluster pods. You can create the pods in the management cluster in the following order from highest to lowest:

* `hypershift-operator`: HyperShift Operator pods.
* `hypershift-etcd`: Pods for etcd.
* `hypershift-api-critical`: Pods that are required for API calls and resource admission to succeed. These pods include pods such as `kube-apiserver`, aggregated API servers, and web hooks.
* `hypershift-control-plane`: Pods in the control plane that are not API-critical but still need elevated priority, such as the cluster version Operator.
