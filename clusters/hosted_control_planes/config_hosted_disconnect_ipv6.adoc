= Configuring hosted control planes on an IPv6 network

The IPv6 network configuration is currently designated as disconnected. The primary reason for this designation is because remote registries do not function with IPv6.

The process to configure hosted control planes on an IPv6 network involves the following steps, which are described in detail in the sections that follow:  

. Configure the hypervisor for an IPv6 network
. Configuring DNS for an IPv6 network
. Deploying a registry for an IPv6 network
. Setting up a management cluster for an IPv6 network
. Configuring the web server for an IPv6 network
. Configuring image mirroring for an IPv6 network
. Deploying {mce-short} for an IPv6 network
. Configuring TLS certificates for an IPv6 network
. Deploying the hosted cluster for an IPv6 network
. Finishing the deployment for an IPv6 network
