[#hosting-service-cluster-configure-aws]
= Configuring the hosting cluster on AWS (Technology Preview)

To configure hosted control planes, you need a hosting cluster and a hosted cluster. By deploying the HyperShift Operator on an existing managed cluster by using the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on, you can enable that cluster as a hosting cluster and start to create the hosted cluster.

The hosted control planes feature is enabled by default.

The {mce-short} 2.4 supports only the default `local-cluster` and the hub cluster as the hosting cluster.

You can deploy hosted control planes by configuring an existing cluster to function as a hosting cluster. The hosting cluster is the {ocp} cluster where the control planes are hosted. {product-title-short} 2.9 can use the hub cluster, also known as the `local-cluster`, as the hosting cluster. See the following topics to learn how to configure the `local-cluster` as the hosting cluster.

*Important:* 

- Run the hub cluster and workers on the same platform for hosted control planes.

- Each hosted cluster must have a unique name in order for {mce-short} to manage it.

- A hosted cluster cannot be created in the namespace of a {mce-short} managed cluster.

[#hosting-service-cluster-configure-prereq-aws]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites to configure a hosting cluster: 

* The {mce} 2.4 and later installed on an {ocp-short} cluster. The {mce-short} is automatically installed when you install {product-title-short}. The {mce-short} can also be installed without {product-title-short} as an Operator from the {ocp-short} OperatorHub.

* The {mce-short} must have at least one managed {ocp-short} cluster. The `local-cluster` is automatically imported in {mce-short} 2.4 and later. See xref:../install_upgrade/adv_config_install.adoc#advanced-config-engine[Advanced configuration] for more information about the `local-cluster`. You can check the status of your hub cluster by running the following command:

+
----
oc get managedclusters local-cluster
----

* The AWS command line interface. 

* The xref:../hosted_control_planes/install_hcp_cli.adoc#hosted-install-cli[hosted control plane command line interface].

For additional resources about hosted control planes, see the following documentation:

* To disable the hosted control planes feature or, if you already disabled it and want to manually enable it, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/enable_or_disable_hosted.adoc#enable-or-disable-hosted-control-planes[Enabling or disabling the hosted control planes feature].

* To manage hosted clusters by running {aap} jobs, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/ansible_config_hosted_cluster.adoc#ansible-config-hosted-cluster[Configuring {aap-short} jobs to run on hosted clusters].

* To deploy the SR-IOV Operator, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/networking/hardware-networks#sriov-operator-hosted-control-planes_configuring-sriov-operator[Deploying the SR-IOV Operator for hosted control planes].
