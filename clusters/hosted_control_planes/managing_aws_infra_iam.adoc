= Managing AWS infrastructure and IAM permissions for hosted control planes (Technology Preview)

When you use hosted control planes for {ocp} on AWS, the infrastructure requirements vary based on your setup. 

* <<hosted-aws-infra-iam-prereqs,Prerequisites>>
* <<hosting-cluster-aws-infra-reqs,AWS infrastructure requirements>>
* <<hosting-cluster-iam-permissions,Identity and Access Management permissions>>

[#hosted-aws-infra-iam-prereqs]
== Prerequisites

You must configure hosted control planes before you can create hosted control plane clusters. See xref:../../clusters/hosted_control_planes/configure_hosted_aws.adoc#hosting-service-cluster-configure-aws[Configuring hosted control planes (Technology Preview)] for more information.

[#hosting-cluster-aws-infra-reqs]
== AWS infrastructure requirements

When you use hosted control planes on AWS, the infrastructure requirements fit in the following categories:

* Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator in an arbitrary AWS account
* Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account
* Hosted control planes-managed infrastructure in a management AWS account
* Hosted control planes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account
* Kubernetes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account

_Prerequired_ means that hosted control planes requires AWS infrastructure to properly work. _Unmanaged_ means that no Operator or controller creates the infrastructure for you. The following sections contain details about the creation of the AWS resources.

[#infra-prerequired-unmanaged-for-ho]
=== Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator in an arbitrary AWS account

An arbitrary AWS account depends on the provider of the hosted control planes service. 

In self-managed hosted control planes, the cluster service provider controls the AWS account. The _cluster service provider_ is the administrator who hosts cluster control planes and is responsible for uptime. In managed hosted control planes, the AWS account belongs to Red&nbsp;Hat.

In a prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator, the following infrastructure requirements apply for a management cluster AWS account:

* One S3 Bucket
** OpenID Connect (OIDC)
* Route 53 hosted zones
** A domain to host private and public entries for hosted clusters

[#infra-prerequired-unmanaged-hosted-cluster-aws]
=== Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account

When your infrastructure is prerequired and unmanaged in a hosted cluster AWS account, the infrastructure requirements for all access modes are as follows:

* One VPC
* One DHCP Option
* Two subnets
** A private subnet that is an internal data plane subnet
** A public subnet that enables access to the internet from the data plane
* One internet gateway
* One elastic IP
* One NAT gateway
* One security group (worker nodes)
* Two route tables (one private and one public)
* Two route 53 hosted zones
* Enough quota for the following items:
** One Ingress service load balancer for public hosted clusters
** One private link endpoint for private hosted clusters

*Note:* For private link networking to work, the endpoint zone in the hosted cluster AWS account must match the zone of the instance that is resolved by the service endpoint in the management cluster AWS account. In AWS, the zone names are aliases, such as `us-east-2b`, which do not necessarily map to the same zone in different accounts. As a result, for private link to work, the management cluster must have subnets or workers in all zones of its region.

[#infra-managed-by-hypershift-mgmt-aws-acct]
=== Hosted control planes-managed infrastructure in a management AWS account

When your infrastructure is managed by hosted control planes in a management AWS account, the infrastructure requirements differ depending on whether your clusters are public, private, or a combination.

For accounts with public clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Network load balancer: a load balancer Kube API server
** Kubernetes creates a security group
* Volumes
** For etcd (one or three depending on high availability)
** For OVN-Kube

For accounts with private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Network load balancer: a load balancer private router
* Endpoint service (private link)

For accounts with public and private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Network load balancer: a load balancer public router
* Network load balancer: a load balancer private router
* Endpoint service (private link)
* Volumes:
** For etcd (one or three depending on high availability)
** For OVN-Kube

[#infra-managed-by-hypershift-in-hosted-cluster-aws-acct]
=== Hosted control planes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account

When your infrastructure is managed by hosted control planes in a hosted cluster AWS account, the infrastructure requirements differ depending on whether your clusters are public, private, or a combination.

For accounts with public clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Node pools must have EC2 instances that have `Role` and `RolePolicy` defined.

For accounts with private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* One private link endpoint for each availability zone
* EC2 instances for node pools

For accounts with public and private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* One private link endpoint for each availability zone
* EC2 instances for node pools

[#infra-managed-by-kubernetes-in-hosted-cluster-aws-acct]
=== Kubernetes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account

When Kubernetes manages your infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* A network load balancer for default Ingress
* An S3 bucket for registry

[#iam-aws]
== Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions

In the context of hosted control planes, the consumer is responsible to create the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) roles. The _consumer_ is an automated process to generate the permissions files. The consumer might be the command line interface or OpenShift Cluster Manager. Hosted control planes tries to enable granularity to honor the principle of least-privilege components, which means that every component uses its own role to operate or create AWS objects, and the roles are limited to what is required for the product to function normally.

//I'm keeping the next line commented-out until that documentation has been ported from upstream
//For an example of how the command line interface can create the ARN roles, see link:NEED LINK[Creating AWS infrastructure and IAM resources separately].

The hosted cluster receives the ARN roles as input and the consumer creates an AWS permission configuration for each component. As a result, the component can authenticate through STS and preconfigured OIDC IDP.

The following roles are consumed by some of the components from hosted control planes that run on the control plane and operate on the data plane:

* `controlPlaneOperatorARN`
* `imageRegistryARN`
* `ingressARN`
* `kubeCloudControllerARN`
* `nodePoolManagementARN`
* `storageARN`
* `networkARN`

The following example shows a reference to the IAM roles from the hosted cluster:
