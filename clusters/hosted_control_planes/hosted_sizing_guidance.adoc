= Hosted control plane sizing guidance

Many factors, including hosted cluster workload and worker node count, affect how many hosted clusters can fit within a certain number of control-plane nodes. Use this sizing guide to help with hosted cluster capacity planning. This guidance assumes a highly available hosted control plane topology. The load-based sizing examples were measured on a bare-metal cluster. Cloud-based instances might have different limiting factors, such as memory size. For more information about highly available hosted control plane topology, see _Distributing hosted cluster workloads_.

See the following highly available hosted control plane requirements, which were tested with {ocp-short} version 4.12.9 and later:

* 78 pods
* Three 8 GiB PVs for etcd
* Minimum vCPU: approximately 5.5 cores
* Minimum memory: approximately 19 GiB

[#hosted-sizing-guidance-pod-limit]
== Pod limits

The `maxPods` setting for each node affects how many hosted clusters can fit in a control-plane node. It is important to note the `maxPods` value on all control-plane nodes. Plan for about 75 pods for each highly available hosted control plane. 

For bare-metal nodes, the default `maxPods` setting of 250 is likely to be a limiting factor because roughly three hosted control planes fit for each node given the pod requirements, even if the machine has plenty of resources to spare. Setting the `maxPods` value to 500 by configuring the `KubeletConfig` value allows for greater hosted control plane density, which can help you take advantage of additional compute resources. For more information, see _Configuring the maximum number of pods per node_ in the {ocp-short} documentation.

[#hosted-sizing-guidance-request-based-limit]
== Request-based resource limit

To understand the request-based resource limit, consider the total request value of a hosted control plane. To calculate that value, add the request values of all highly available hosted control plane pods across the namespace. See the following examples:

* Five vCPU requests for each highly available hosted control plane
* 18 GiB memory requests for each highly available hosted control plane

[#hosted-sizing-guidance-load-based-limit]
== Load-based limit

Request-based sizing provides a maximum number of hosted control planes that can run based on the minimum request totals for the `Burstable` class, which meet the average resource usage. For sizing guidance that is tuned to higher levels of hosted cluster load, the load-based approach demonstrates resource usage at increasing API rates. The load-based approach builds in resource capacity for each hosted control plane to handle higher API load points.

For example, to demonstrate resource scaling with API load, consider the following workload configuration:

 One hosted cluster with 9 workers (8 vCPU, 32 GiB each), using the KubeVirt provider
 Benchmark tool: link:https://github.com/cloud-bulldozer/kube-burner[Kube-burner]
* The workload profile is a cluster density test that is configured to focus on API control-plane stress, based on this link:https://cloud-bulldozer.github.io/kube-burner/v1.7.9/ocp/#cluster-density-v2[definition]:

** Creates objects per namespace, scaling up to 100 namespaces total
** The `churn` parameter is enabled to cause additional API stress with continuous object deletion and creation
** The workload queries per second (QPS) and `Burst` settings are set high to remove any client-side throttling

Resource utilization is measured as the workload increased to the total namespace count. This data provided an estimation factor to increase the compute resource capacity based on the expected API load. Exact utilization rates can vary based on the type and pace of the cluster workload. 

|===
| Hosted control plane resource utilization scaling | vCPUs | Memory (GiB)

| Default requests 
| 5 
| 18

| Usage when idle 
| 2.9 
| 11.1

| Incremental usage per 1000 increase in API rate 
| 9.0 
| 2.5
|===

By using these examples, you can factor in a load-based limit that is based on the expected rate of stress on the API, which is measured as the aggregated QPS across the 3 hosted API servers. For general sizing purposes, consider a 1000 QPS API rate to be a medium hosted cluster load and a 2000 QPS API to be a heavy hosted cluster load.

To determine the API rate of an active hosted cluster, measure the number of queries per second for the appropriate hosted namespace by using the following metric, which you can query from the Administrator perspective in the {ocp-short} web console by selecting *Observe* -> *Metrics*:

----
sum(rate(apiserver_request_total{namespace=~"clusters-$name*"}[2m])) by (namespace)
----

The following example shows hosted control plane resource scaling for the workload and API rate definitions:

|===
| QPS (API rate) | vCPU usage | Memory usage (GiB)

| Less than 50 QPS (low) 
| 2.9 
| 11.1

| 1000 QPS (medium) 
| 11.9 
| 13.6

| 2000 QPS (high) 
| 20.9 
| 16.1
|===

The hosted control plane sizing is about control-plane load and workloads that cause heavy API activity, etcd activity, or both. Hosted pod workloads that focus on data-plane loads, such as running a database, might not result in high API rates.

[#hosted-sizing-guidance-examples]
== Sizing calculation example

This example provides sizing guidance for the following scenario:

* Three bare-metal workers that are labeled as `hypershift.openshift.io/control-plane` nodes
* `maxPods` value set to 500
* The expected API rate is medium or about 1000, according to the load-based limits
