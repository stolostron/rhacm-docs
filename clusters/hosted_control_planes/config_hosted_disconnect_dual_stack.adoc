= Configuring hosted control planes on a dual stack network (Technology Preview)

The dual-stack network configuration is currently designated as disconnected. The primary reason for this designation is because remote registries do not function with IPv6.

The process to configure hosted control planes on a dual-stack network involves the following steps, which are described in detail in the sections that follow:  

. Configure the hypervisor for a dual-stack network
. Configuring DNS for a dual-stack network
. Deploying a registry for a dual-stack network
. Setting up a management cluster for a dual-stack network
. Configuring the web server for a dual-stack network
. Configuring image mirroring for a dual-stack network
. Deploying {mce-short} for a dual-stack network
. Configuring TLS certificates for a dual-stack network
. Deploying the hosted cluster for a dual-stack network
. Finishing the deployment for a dual-stack network
