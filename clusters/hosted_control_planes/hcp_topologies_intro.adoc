[#hosting-cluster-topologies]
= Understanding hosting cluster topologies

You can deploy hosted clusters on a single or multiple {ocp-short} clusters and manage them by using the {mce-short} or {product-title-short} hub cluster.

If you installed {product-title-short}, you do not need to install the {mce-short}, as it is automatically installed. The {mce-short} contains the hosted control planes feature. The {mce-short} provides cluster management capabilities for {product-title-short}. Therefore, the {mce-short} hub cluster also means the {product-title-short} hub cluster.

Review the following hosting cluster topologies:

* Using the {mce-short} hub cluster as a hosting cluster.

* Using the {ocp-short} cluster as a hosting cluster managed by {mce-short}.

* Using the {mce-short} hub cluster as a hosting cluster managed by {product-title-short}.
