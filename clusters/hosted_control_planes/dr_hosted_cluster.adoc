= Disaster recovery for a hosted cluster

The hosted control plane runs on the {mce-short} hub cluster. The data plane runs on a separate platform that you choose. When recovering the {mce-short} hub cluster from a disaster, you might also want to recover the hosted control planes.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/hosted_control_planes/hcp-backup-restore-dr#hcp-dr-aws[Disaster recovery for a hosted cluster within an AWS region] to learn how to back up a hosted control plane cluster and restore it on a different cluster.

*Important:* Disaster recovery for hosted clusters is available on AWS only.
