[#hosted-cluster-workload-distributing]
= Distributing hosted cluster workloads (Technology Preview)

As a management cluster administrator, you can use the following labels and taints in the management cluster nodes to schedule the control plane workload:

* `hypershift.openshift.io/control-plane: true`
* `hypershift.openshift.io/cluster: ${HostedControlPlane Namespace}`

Pods for a hosted cluster have tolerations, and the scheduler uses affinity rules to schedule them. Pods tolerate taints for `control-plane` and the `cluster` for the pods. The scheduler prioritizes the scheduling of pods into nodes that are labeled with `hypershift.openshift.io/control-plane` and `hypershift.openshift.io/cluster: ${HostedControlPlane Namespace}`.

For the `ControllerAvailabilityPolicy` option, use `HighlyAvailable`. When you use that option, you can schedule pods for each deployment within a hosted cluster across different failure domains by setting `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` as the topology key.

To enable a hosted cluster to require its pods to be scheduled into infrastructure nodes, set `HostedCluster.spec.nodeSelector`, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
    nodeSelector:
      role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
----

This way, hosted control planes for each tenant are eligible infrastructure node workloads, and you do not need to entitle the underlying {ocp-short} nodes.

[#hosted-cluster-workload-distributing-priority]
== Priority classes

Four built-in priority classes influence the priority and preemption of the hosted cluster pods. You can create the pods in the management cluster in the following order from highest to lowest:

* `hypershift-operator`: HyperShift Operator pods.
* `hypershift-etcd`: Pods for etcd.
* `hypershift-api-critical`: Pods that are required for API calls and resource admission to succeed. These pods include pods such as `kube-apiserver`, aggregated API servers, and web hooks.
* `hypershift-control-plane`: Pods in the control plane that are not API-critical but still need elevated priority, such as the cluster version Operator.
