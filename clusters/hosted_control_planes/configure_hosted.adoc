[#hosted-control-planes-configure]
= Configuring hosted control planes (Technology Preview)

To configure hosted control planes, you need a hosting cluster and a hosted cluster. By deploying the HyperShift operator on an existing managed cluster by using the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on, you can make that cluster into a hosting cluster and start the creation of the hosted cluster. The {mce} 2.2 only supports the default `local-cluster` and the hub cluster as the hosting cluster.

Hosted control planes is a Technology Preview feature, so the related components are disabled by default. See the following topics to learn more about how to enable hosted control planes.

[#hosting-service-cluster-configure]
== Configuring the hosting cluster

You can deploy hosted control planes by configuring an existing cluster to function as a hosting cluster. The hosting cluster is the {ocp} cluster where the control planes are hosted. {product-title-short} 2.7 can use the hub cluster, also known as the `local-cluster`, as the hosting cluster. See the following topics to learn how to configure the `local-cluster` as the hosting cluster.

*Best practice:* Be sure to run the hub cluster and workers on the same platform for hosted control planes.

[#hosting-service-cluster-configure-prereq]
=== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites to configure a hosting cluster: 

* The {mce} 2.2 and later installed on an {ocp-short} cluster. The {mce-short} is automatically installed when you install {product-title-short}. The {mce-short} can also be installed without {product-title-short} as an operator from the {ocp-short} OperatorHub.

* The {mce-short} must have at least one managed {ocp-short} cluster. The `local-cluster` is automatically imported in {mce} 2.2 and later. See xref:../install_upgrade/adv_config_install.adoc#advanced-config-engine[Advanced configuration] for more information about the `local-cluster`. You can check the status of your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get managedclusters local-cluster
----

* A hosting cluster with at least 3 worker nodes to run the HyperShift Operator.

[#hosted-create-aws-secret]
=== Creating the Amazon Web Services S3 OIDC secret

If you plan to create and manage hosted clusters on AWS, complete the following steps:

. Create an OIDC S3 credentials secret named `hypershift-operator-oidc-provider-s3-credentials` for the HyperShift operator.

. Save the secret in the `local-cluster` namespace.

. See the following table to make sure that the secret contains the following fields:
+
|===
| Field name | Description

| `bucket`
| Contains an S3 bucket with public access to host OIDC discovery documents for your HyperShift clusters.

| `credentials`
| A reference to a file that contains the credentials of the `default` profile that can access the bucket. By default, HyperShift only uses the `default` profile to operate the `bucket`. 

| `region`
| Specifies the region of the S3 bucket.
|===
+
See https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/getting-started/[Getting started] in the HyperShift documentation for more information about the secret. The following example shows a sample AWS secret template:
+
----
oc create secret generic hypershift-operator-oidc-provider-s3-credentials --from-file=credentials=$HOME/.aws/credentials --from-literal=bucket=<s3-bucket-for-hypershift> --from-literal=region=<region> -n local-cluster
----
+
*Note:* Disaster recovery backup for the secret is not automatically enabled. Run the following command to add the label that enables the `hypershift-operator-oidc-provider-s3-credentials` secret to be backed up for disaster recovery:
+
----
oc label secret hypershift-operator-oidc-provider-s3-credentials -n local-cluster cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup=true
----
+

[#hosted-create-public-zone]
=== Creating a routable public zone

To access applications in your guest clusters, the public zone must be routable. If the public zone exists, skip this step. Otherwise, the public zone will affect the existing functions.

Run the following command to create a public zone for cluster DNS records:

----
BASE_DOMAIN=www.example.com
aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name $BASE_DOMAIN --caller-reference $(whoami)-$(date --rfc-3339=date)
----

[#hosted-enable-ext-dns]
=== Enabling external DNS

If you plan to provision hosted control plane clusters with service-level DNS (external DNS), complete the following steps:

. Create an AWS credential secret for the HyperShift Operator and name it `hypershift-operator-external-dns-credentials` in the `local-cluster` namespace.

. See the following table to make sure that the secret contains the required fields:
+
|===
| Field name | Description | Optional or required

| `provider`
| The DNS provider that manages the service-level DNS zone.
| Required

| `domain-filter`
| The service-level domain.
| Required

| `credentials`
| The credential file that supports all external DNS types.
| Optional when using AWS keys

| `aws-access-key-id`
| The credential access key id.
| Optional when using the AWS DNS service

| `aws-secret-access-key`
| The credential access key secret.
| Optional when using the AWS DNS service
|===
+
See https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/how-to/external-dns/[External DNS] in the HyperShift documentation for more information. The following example shows the sample `hypershift-operator-external-dns-credentials` secret template:
+
----
oc create secret generic hypershift-operator-external-dns-credentials --from-literal=provider=aws --from-literal=domain-filter=service.my.domain.com --from-file=credentials=<credentials-file> -n local-cluster
----
+
*Note:* Disaster recovery backup for the secret is not automatically enabled. Run the following command to add the label that enables the `hypershift-operator-external-dns-credentials` secret to be backed up for disaster recovery:
+
----
oc label secret hypershift-operator-external-dns-credentials -n local-cluster cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup=""
----

[#hosted-enable-private-link]
=== Enabling AWS PrivateLink

If you plan to provision hosted control plane clusters on the AWS platform with PrivateLink, complete the following steps:

. Create an AWS credential secret for the HyperShift operator and name it `hypershift-operator-private-link-credentials`. The secret must reside in the managed cluster namespace that is the namespace of the managed cluster being used as the hosting cluster. If you used `local-cluster`, create the secret in the `local-cluster` namespace.
+

. See the following table to make sure that the secret contains the required fields:
+
|===
| Field name | Description | Optional or required

| `region`
| Region for use with Private Link
| Required

| `aws-access-key-id`
| The credential access key id.
| Required

| `aws-secret-access-key`
| The credential access key secret.
| Required
|===
+
See https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/how-to/aws/deploy-aws-private-clusters/[Deploying AWS private clusters] in the HyperShift documentation for more information. The following example shows the sample `hypershift-operator-private-link-credentials` secret template:
+
----
oc create secret generic hypershift-operator-private-link-credentials --from-literal=aws-access-key-id=<aws-access-key-id> --from-literal=aws-secret-access-key=<aws-secret-access-key> --from-literal=region=<region> -n local-cluster

+
*Note:* Disaster recovery backup for the secret is not automatically enabled. Run the following command to add the label that enables the `hypershift-operator-private-link-credentials` secret to be backed up for disaster recovery:
+
----
oc label secret hypershift-operator-private-link-credentials -n local-cluster cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup=""
----

[#hosted-enable-feature]
=== Enabling the hosted control planes feature

The hosted control planes features is disabled by default. Enabling the feature automatically enables the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on as well. You can run the following command to enable the feature:

----
oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift-preview","enabled": true}]}}}'
----

Run the following command to verify that the `hypershift-preview` and `hypershift-local-hosting` features are enabled in the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource.

----
oc get mce multiclusterengine -o yaml'
----

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1

[#hosted-enable-hypershift-add-on]
==== Manually enabling the _hypershift-addon_ managed cluster add-on for _local-cluster_

Enabling the hosted control planes feature automatically enables the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on. If you need to enable the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on manually, complete the following steps to use the `hypershift-addon` to install the HyperShift Operator on `local-cluster`:

. Create the `ManagedClusterAddon` HyperShift add-on by creating a file that resembles the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  name: hypershift-addon
  namespace: local-cluster 
spec:
  installNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

. Apply the file by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f <filename>
----
+
Replace `filename` with the name of the file that you created. 

. Confirm that the `hypershift-addon` is installed by running the following command:
+
----
oc get managedclusteraddons -n local-cluster hypershift-addon
----

. If the add-on is installed, the output resembles the following example:
+
----
NAME               AVAILABLE   DEGRADED   PROGRESSING
hypershift-addon   True
----

Your HyperShift add-on is installed and the hosting cluster is available to create and manage HyperShift clusters.
