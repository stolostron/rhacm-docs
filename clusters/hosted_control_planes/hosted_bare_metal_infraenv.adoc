= Creating an InfraEnv resource for hosted control planes on bare metal

An `InfraEnv` is a environment where hosts that are starting the live ISO can join as agents. In this case, the agents are created in the same namespace as your hosted control plane.

. Create an `InfraEnv` resource:

.. Create a YAML file to contain the configuration:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: InfraEnv
metadata:
  name: ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}
  namespace: ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} <1>
spec:
  pullSecretRef:
    name: pull-secret
  sshAuthorizedKey: ${SSH_PUB_KEY}
----

+
<1> The namespace for hosted control plane pods.

.. Save the file as `infraenv-config.yaml`.

.. Apply the configuration by entering the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f infraenv-config.yaml
----

. To fetch the URL to download the live ISO that allows virtual machines or bare metal machines to join as agents, enter the following command:

+
----
oc -n ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} get InfraEnv ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME} -ojsonpath="{.status.isoDownloadURL}"
----
