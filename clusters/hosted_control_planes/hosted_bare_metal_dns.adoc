[#configure-dns-bm]
= Configuring DNS on bare metal

The API Server for the hosted cluster is exposed as a `NodePort` service. A DNS entry must exist for `api.${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASEDOMAIN}` that points to destination where the API Server can be reached.

The DNS entry can be as simple as a record that points to one of the nodes in the managed cluster that is running the hosted control plane. The entry can also point to a load balancer that is deployed to redirect incoming traffic to the Ingress pods. 

See the following example DNS configuration:

api.example.krnl.es.    IN A 192.168.122.20
api.example.krnl.es.    IN A 192.168.122.21
