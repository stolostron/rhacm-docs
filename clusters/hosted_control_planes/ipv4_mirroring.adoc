[#ipv4-mirroring]
= Configuring image mirroring for an IPv4 network

Image mirroring is the process of fetching images from external registries, such as `registry.redhat.com` or `quay.io`, and storing them in your private registry.

[#ipv4-mirroring-process]
== Completing the mirroring process

*Note:* Start the mirroring process after the registry server is running.

In the following procedures, the `oc-mirror` tool is used, which is a binary that uses the `ImageSetConfiguration` object. In the file, you can specify the following information:

* The {ocp-short} versions to mirror. The versions are in `quay.io`.
* The additional Operators to mirror. Select packages individually.
* The extra images that you want to add to the repository.

To configure image mirroring, complete the following steps:

. Ensure that your `${HOME}/.docker/config.json` file is updated with the registries that you are going to mirror from and with the private registry that you plan to push the images to.

. By using the following example, create an `ImageSetConfiguration` object to use for mirroring. Replace values as needed to match your environment:

----

+
<1> Replace `_dns.base.domain.name_` with the DNS base domain name.
<2> Replace `4.x.y` with the supported {ocp-short} version you want to use.

. Start the mirroring process by entering the following command:

+
----
oc-mirror --source-skip-tls --config imagesetconfig.yaml docker://${REGISTRY}
----

+
After the mirroring process is finished, you have a new folder named `oc-mirror-workspace/results-XXXXXX/`, which contains the ICSP and the catalog sources to apply on the hosted cluster.

. Mirror the nightly or CI versions of {ocp-short} by using the `oc adm release mirror` command. Enter the following command:

+
----
REGISTRY=registry.$(hostname --long):5000

oc adm release mirror \
  --from=registry.ci.openshift.org/ocp/release:4.x.y-x86_64 \
  --to=${REGISTRY}/openshift/release \
  --to-release-image=${REGISTRY}/openshift/release-images:4.x.y-x86_64
----
+
Replace `4.x.y` with the supported {ocp-short} version you want to use.

. Mirror the latest {mce-short} images by following the steps in xref:../install_upgrade/install_disconnected.adoc#install-on-disconnected-networks[Install on disconnected networks].

[#ipv4-mirroring-applying]
== Applying objects in the management cluster

After the mirroring process is complete, you need to apply two objects in the management cluster:

* Image Content Source Policies (ICSP) or Image Digest Mirror Set (IDMS)
* Catalog sources

When you use the `oc-mirror` tool, the output artifacts are in a folder named `oc-mirror-workspace/results-XXXXXX/`.

ICSP or IDMS initiates a `MachineConfig` change that does not restart your nodes but restarts the kubelet on each of them. After the nodes are marked as `READY`, you need to apply the newly generated catalog sources.

The catalog sources initiate actions in the `openshift-marketplace` Operator, such as downloading the catalog image and processing it to retrieve all the `PackageManifests` that are included in that image.

. To check the new sources, run the following command by using the new `CatalogSource` as a source:

+
----
oc get packagemanifest
----

. To apply the artifacts, complete the following steps:

.. Create the ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) or IDMS artifacts by entering the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f oc-mirror-workspace/results-XXXXXX/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----

.. Wait for the nodes to become ready, and then enter the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f catalogSource-XXXXXXXX-index.yaml
----


. Mirror the OLM catalogs and configure the hosed cluster to point to the mirror.

+
When you use the `management` (default) OLMCatalogPlacement mode, the image stream that is used for OLM catalogs is not automatically amended with override information from the ICSP on the management cluster.

+
.. If the OLM catalogs are properly mirrored to an internal registry by using the original name and tag, add the `hypershift.openshift.io/olm-catalogs-is-registry-overrides` annotation to the `HostedCluster` resource. The format is `"sr1=dr1,sr2=dr2"`, where the source registry string is a key and the destination registry is a value.

.. To bypass the OLM catalog image stream mechanism, use the following four annotations on the `HostedCluster` resource to directly specify the addresses of the four images to use for OLM operator catalogs:

** `hypershift.openshift.io/certified-operators-catalog-image`
** `hypershift.openshift.io/community-operators-catalog-image`
** `hypershift.openshift.io/redhat-marketplace-catalog-image`
** `hypershift.openshift.io/redhat-operators-catalog-image`

+
In this case, the image stream is not created, and you must update the value of the annotations when the internal mirror is refreshed to pull in operator updates.

+
*Note:* If the override mechanism is required, all four values for the four default catalog sources are needed.

[#ipv4-mirroring-additional-resources]
== Additional resources

* If you are working in a virtual environment, after you configure mirroring, ensure that you meet the xref:../hosted_control_planes/kubevirt_intro.adoc#create-hosted-clusters-prereqs-kubevirt[prerequisites for hosted control planes on OpenShift Virtualization].

* For more information about mirroring nightly or CI versions of {ocp-short}, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform_installation/4.14/html-single/disconnected_installation_mirroring/index#installing-mirroring-disconnected[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation using the oc-mirror plugin].
