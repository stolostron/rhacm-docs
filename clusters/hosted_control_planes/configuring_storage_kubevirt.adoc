[#configuring-storage-kubevirt]
= Configuring storage for hosted control planes on OpenShift Virtualization

If no advanced configuration is provided, the default storage class is used for the KubeVirt virtual machine (VM) images, the KubeVirt CSI mapping, and the etcd volumes.

[#storageclass-mapping]
== Mapping KubeVirt CSI storage classes

KubeVirt CSI permits any infrastructure storage class with the `ReadWriteMany` access mode to be exposed to the hosted cluster. This mapping of infrastructure cluster storage class to hosted cluster storage class can be configured during cluster creation by using the `hcp` command line interface and the `--infra-storage-class-mapping` argument.

To map infrastructure storage classes to hosted storage classes, see the following example. The example shows how to map two infrastructure storage classes called `infra-sc1` and `infra-sc2` to hosted storage classes called `guest-sc1` and `guest-sc2`. The `--infra-storage-class-mapping` argument can be used multiple times within the `create` command:

----
export CLUSTER_NAME=example
export PULL_SECRET="$HOME/pull-secret"
export MEM="6Gi"
export CPU="2"
export WORKER_COUNT="2"

hcp create cluster kubevirt \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--node-pool-replicas $WORKER_COUNT \
--pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
--memory $MEM \
--cores $CPU \
--infra-storage-class-mapping=infra-sc1/guest-sc1 \
--infra-storage-class-mapping=infra-sc2/guest-sc2 
----

After you create the hosted cluster, the `guest-sc1` and `guest-sc2` storage classes are visible within the hosted cluster. When you create a PVC within the hosted cluster that uses one of those storage classes, KubeVirt CSI provisions that volume by using the infrastructure storage class mapping that you configured during cluster creation.

*Note:* KubeVirt CSI supports mapping only a infrastructure storage class that is capable of `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access.

[#kubevirt-vm-root-volume-config]
== Configuring KubeVirt VM root volume

At cluster creation time, you can configure the storage class that is used to host the KubeVirt VM root volumes by using the `hcp` command line interface and the `--root-volume-storage-class` argument. You can configure the size of the volume by using the `--root-volume-size` argument.

To set a custom storage class and volume size for KubeVirt VMs, see the following example. In the example, the result is a hosted cluster with VMs that are hosted on 64Gi PVCs that are hosted by the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rdb` storage class:

----
export CLUSTER_NAME=example
export PULL_SECRET="$HOME/pull-secret"
export MEM="6Gi"
export CPU="2"
export WORKER_COUNT="2"

hcp create cluster kubevirt \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--node-pool-replicas $WORKER_COUNT \
--pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
--memory $MEM \
--cores $CPU \
--root-volume-storage-class ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd \
--root-volume-size 64

[#kubevirt-vm-image-caching]
== Enabling KubeVirt VM image caching

KubeVirt image caching is an advanced feature that you can use to optimize both cluster startup time and storage utilization. This feature requires the use of a storage class that is capable of smart cloning and the `ReadWriteMany` access mode. For more information about smart cloning, see _Cloning a data volume using smart-cloning_.

Image caching works as follows:

. The VM image is imported to a PVC that is associated with the hosted cluster.
. A unique clone of that PVC is created for every KubeVirt VM that is added as a worker node to the cluster. 

Image caching reduces VM startup time by requiring only a single image import. It can further reduce overall cluster storage usage when the storage class supports copy-on-write cloning.

To enable image caching, during cluster creation, use the `hcp` command line interface and the `--root-volume-cache-strategy=PVC` argument, as shown in the following example:

----
export CLUSTER_NAME=example
export PULL_SECRET="$HOME/pull-secret"
export MEM="6Gi"
export CPU="2"
export WORKER_COUNT="2"

hcp create cluster kubevirt \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--node-pool-replicas $WORKER_COUNT \
--pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
--memory $MEM \
--cores $CPU \
--root-volume-cache-strategy=PVC

[#etcd-storage-configuration-kubevirt]
== Configuring etcd storage

At cluster creation time, you can configure the storage class that is used to host etcd data by using the `hcp` command line interface and the `--etcd-storage-class` argument. If you do not provide an `--etcd-storage-class` argument, the default storage class is used.

To configure a storage class for etcd, see the following example:

----
export CLUSTER_NAME=example
export PULL_SECRET="$HOME/pull-secret"
export MEM="6Gi"
export CPU="2"
export WORKER_COUNT="2"
export ETCD_STORAGE="lvm-storageclass"

hcp create cluster kubevirt \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--node-pool-replicas $WORKER_COUNT \
--pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
--memory $MEM \
--cores $CPU \
--etcd-storage-class=${ETCD_STORAGE}
