= Creating an InfraEnv resource for hosted control planes on x86 bare metal for IBM Z compute nodes

An `InfraEnv` is an environment where hosts that are booted with PXE images can join as agents. In this case, the agents are created in the same namespace as your hosted control plane.

See the following procedure to create an `InfraEnv` resource:

. Create a YAML file to contain the configuration. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: InfraEnv
metadata:
  name: ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}
  namespace: ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  cpuArchitecture: s390x 
  pullSecretRef:
    name: pull-secret
  sshAuthorizedKey: ${SSH_PUB_KEY}
----

. Save the file as `infraenv-config.yaml`.

. Apply the configuration by entering the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f infraenv-config.yaml
----

. To fetch the URL to download the PXE images, such as, `initrd.img`, `kernel.img`, or `rootfs.img`, which allows IBM Z machines to join as agents, enter the following command:

+
----
oc -n <hosted_control_plane_namespace> get InfraEnv <hosted_cluster_name> -o json
----
