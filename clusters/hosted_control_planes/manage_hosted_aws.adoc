[#hosted-control-planes-manage-aws]
= Managing hosted control plane clusters on AWS (Technology Preview)

You can use the hosted control plane command line interface, `hcp`, to create an {ocp-short} hosted cluster. The hosted cluster is automatically imported as a managed cluster. If you want to disable this automatic import feature, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/disable_auto_import.adoc#hosted-disable-auto-import[Disabling the automatic import of hosted clusters into {mce-short}].

*Note:* Each hosted cluster must have a unique name in order for {mce-short} to manage it.

//lahinson - july 2023 - should we specify which CLI we're referring to in the latter sentence?
