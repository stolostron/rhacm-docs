[#hosted-control-planes-manage-kubevirt]
= Managing hosted control plane clusters on OpenShift Virtualization (Technology Preview)

With hosted control planes and {ocp-virt}, you can create {ocp-short} clusters with worker nodes that are hosted by KubeVirt virtual machines. Hosted control planes on {ocp-virt-short} provides several benefits: 

* Enhances resource usage by packing hosted control planes and hosted clusters in the same underlying bare metal infrastructure
* Separates hosted control planes and guest clusters to provide strong isolation
* Reduces cluster provision time by eliminating the bare metal node bootstrapping process
* Manages many releases under the same base {ocp-short} cluster

To learn how to create a hosted control plane cluster on {ocp-virt-short}, see the following sections:

== Prerequisites

You must meet the following prerequisites to create an {ocp-short} cluster on {ocp-virt-short}:

- You need administrator access to an {ocp-short} cluster, version 4.12 or later, specified by the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.
- The {ocp-short} managed cluster must have wildcard DNS routes enabled, as shown in the following DNS:

+
----
oc patch ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator default --type=json -p '[{ "op": "add", "path": "/spec/routeAdmission", "value": {wildcardPolicy: "WildcardsAllowed"}}]'
----
- The {ocp-short} managed cluster must have {ocp-virt-short} installed on it. For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/virt/install/installing-virt-web.html[Installing OpenShift Virtualization using the web console].
- The {ocp-short} managed cluster must be configured with OVNKubernetes as the default pod network CNI.
- The {ocp-short} managed cluster must have a default storage class. For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/post_installation_configuration/storage-configuration.html[Post-installation storage configuration]. The following example shows how to set a default storage class:

+
----
oc patch storageclass ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
----
- You need a valid pull secret file for the `quay.io/openshift-release-dev` repository. For more information, see link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/platform-agnostic/user-provisioned[Install OpenShift on any x86_64 platform with user-provisioned infrastructure].
- You need to enable the hosted control planes feature. For information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/configure_hosted_aws.adoc#hosted-enable-feature-aws[Enabling the hosted control planes feature].
- After you enable the hosted control planes feature, you need to xref:../hosted_control_planes/configure_hosted_aws.adoc#hosted-install-cli[install the hosted control planes (`hypershift`) command line interface binary].
- Before you can provision your cluster, you need to configure a load balancer. For more information, see <<hosting-service-cluster-configure-metallb-config,Configuring a load balancer>>.

[#creating-a-hosted-cluster-kubevirt]
== Creating a hosted cluster with the KubeVirt platform

. To create a guest cluster, use environment variables and the `hypershift` command line interface:

+
----
export CLUSTER_NAME=example
export PULL_SECRET="$HOME/pull-secret"
export MEM="6Gi"
export CPU="2"
export WORKER_COUNT="2"

hypershift create cluster kubevirt \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--node-pool-replicas $WORKER_COUNT \
--pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
--memory $MEM \
--cores $CPU
----
+
Replace values as necessary.
+
*Note:* You can use the `--release-image` flag to set up the hosted cluster with a specific {ocp-short} release.
+
A default node pool is created for the cluster with two virtual machine worker replicas according to the `--node-pool-replicas` flag.
+
After a few moments, you can verify that the hosted control plane pods are running by entering the following command:

+
----
oc -n clusters-$CLUSTER_NAME get pods
----

+
.Example output

. To retrieve the guest cluster kubeconfig environment variable by using the `hypershift` command line interface, enter the following command:

+
----
hypershift create kubeconfig --name $CLUSTER_NAME > $CLUSTER_NAME-kubeconfig
----

[#create-hosted-clusters-kubevirt-default-ingress-dns]
== Default Ingress and DNS behavior

Every {ocp-short} cluster includes a default application Ingress controller, which must have an wildcard DNS record associated with it. By default, guest clusters that are created by using the HyperShift KubeVirt provider automatically become a subdomain of the underlying {ocp-short} cluster that the KubeVirt virtual machines run on.

For example, your {ocp-short} cluster might have the default Ingress DNS entry of `*.apps.mgmt-cluster.example.com`.

As a result, a KubeVirt guest cluster that is named `guest` and that runs on that underlying {ocp-short} cluster has the default Ingress of `*.apps.guest.apps.mgmt-cluster.example.com`.

*Note:* For the default Ingress DNS to work properly, the underlying cluster that hosts the KubeVirt virtual machines must allow wildcard DNS routes. You can configure this behavior by entering the following command: `oc patch ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator default --type=json -p '[{ "op": "add", "path": "/spec/routeAdmission", "value": {wildcardPolicy: "WildcardsAllowed"}}]'`

[#create-hosted-clusters-kubevirt-customized-ingress-dns]
== Customizing Ingress and DNS behavior

If you do not want to use the default Ingress and DNS behavior, you can configure a KubeVirt guest cluster with a unique base domain at creation time. This option requires manual configuration steps during creation and involves three main steps: cluster creation, load balancer creation, and wildcard DNS configuration.

[#deploy-hosted-cluster-base-domain]
=== Deploying a hosted cluster that specifies the base domain

. To create a hosted cluster that specifies the base domain, enter the following commands:

+
----
export CLUSTER_NAME=example <1>
export PULL_SECRET="$HOME/pull-secret"
export MEM="6Gi"
export CPU="2"
export WORKER_COUNT="2"
export BASE_DOMAIN=hypershift.lab <2>

hypershift create cluster kubevirt \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--node-pool-replicas $WORKER_COUNT \
--pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
--memory $MEM \
--cores $CPU \
--base-domain $BASE_DOMAIN
----
+
<1> The name of the hosted cluster, which for example purposes, is `example`.
+
<2> The base domain, which for example purposes, is `hypershift.lab`.
+
The result is a hosted cluster that has an Ingress wildcard that is configured for the cluster name and the base domain, or as shown in this example, `.apps.example.hypershift.lab`. The hosted cluster does not finish the deployment, but remains in `Partial` status. Because you configured a base domain, you must ensure that the required DNS records and load balancer are in place.

. Enter the following command:

+
----
oc get --namespace clusters hostedclusters
----
+
.Example output
----

. Access the cluster by entering the following commands:

+
----

----
+
----
oc --kubeconfig $CLUSTER_NAME-kubeconfig get co
----

+
*Note:* If your cluster is on bare metal, you might need MetalLB so that you can set up load balancer services. For more information, see _Optional: Configuring MetalLB_.

[#set-up-load-balancer]
=== Setting up the load balancer 

Set up the load balancer that routes to the KubeVirt VMs and assign a wildcard DNS entry to the load balancer IP address. You need to create a load balancer service that routes Ingress traffic to the KubeVirt VMs. A `NodePort` service that exposes the hosted cluster Ingress already exists, so you can export the node ports and create the load balancer service that targets those ports.

. Export the node ports by entering the following commands:

+
----
export HTTP_NODEPORT=$(oc --kubeconfig $CLUSTER_NAME-kubeconfig get services -n openshift-ingress router-nodeport-default -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http")].nodePort}')
export HTTPS_NODEPORT=$(oc --kubeconfig $CLUSTER_NAME-kubeconfig get services -n openshift-ingress router-nodeport-default -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="https")].nodePort}')
----

. Create the load balancer service by entering the following commands:

+
----
oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: $CLUSTER_NAME
  name: $CLUSTER_NAME-apps
  namespace: clusters-$CLUSTER_NAME
spec:
  ports:
  - name: https-443
    port: 443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: ${HTTPS_NODEPORT}
  - name: http-80
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: ${HTTP_NODEPORT}
  selector:
    kubevirt.io: virt-launcher
  type: LoadBalancer
----

[#set-up-wildcard-dns]
=== Setting up a wildcard DNS 

Set up up a wildcard DNS record or CNAME that references the external IP of the load balancer service.

. Export the external IP by entering the following command:

+
----
export EXTERNAL_IP=$(oc -n clusters-$CLUSTER_NAME get service $CLUSTER_NAME-apps -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
----

. Configure a wildcard `*.apps.<hosted-cluster-name\>.<base-domain\>.` DNS entry that references the IP that is stored in the `$EXTERNAL_IP` path. The DNS entry must be able to route inside and outside of the cluster. If you use the example input from step 1, for the cluster that has an external IP value of `192.168.20.30`, the DNS resolutions look like this example:

+
----
dig +short test.apps.example.hypershift.lab

192.168.20.30
----

. Check the hosted cluster status and ensure that it has moved from `Partial` to `Completed` by entering the following command:

+
----
oc get --namespace clusters hostedclusters
----
+
.Example output
----

oc scale nodepool/$NODEPOOL_NAME --namespace clusters --replicas=$NODEPOOL_REPLICAS
----

. After a few moments, enter the following command to see the status of the node pool:

[#create-hosted-clusters-kubevirt-adding-node-pool]
== Adding node pools

You can create node pools for a guest cluster by specifying a name, number of replicas, and any additional information, such as memory and CPU requirements.

. To create a node pool, enter the following information. In this example, the node pool has more CPUs assigned to the VMs:

+
----
export NODEPOOL_NAME=${CLUSTER_NAME}-extra-cpu
export WORKER_COUNT="2"
export MEM="6Gi"
export CPU="4"
export DISK="16"

hypershift create nodepool kubevirt \

oc create -f - 
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: MetalLB
metadata:
  name: metallb
  namespace: metallb-system
----

. Create an address pool with an available range of IP addresses within the node network. Replace the following IP address ranges with an unused pool of available IP addresses in your network.

+
----
oc create -f - 
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: metallb
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.216.32-192.168.216.122
