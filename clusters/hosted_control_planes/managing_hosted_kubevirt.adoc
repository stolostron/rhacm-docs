= Managing hosted control plane clusters on OpenShift Virtualization

With hosted control planes and {ocp-virt}, you can create {ocp-short} clusters with worker nodes that are hosted by KubeVirt virtual machines. Hosted control planes on {ocp-virt-short} provides several benefits: 

* Enhances resource usage by packing hosted control planes and hosted clusters in the same underlying bare metal infrastructure
* Separates hosted control planes and hosted clusters to provide strong isolation
* Reduces cluster provision time by eliminating the bare metal node bootstrapping process
* Manages many releases under the same base {ocp-short} cluster

You can use the hosted control plane command line interface (`hcp`) to create an {ocp-short} hosted cluster. The hosted cluster is automatically imported as a managed cluster. If you want to disable this automatic import feature, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted_disable_auto_import.adoc#hosted-disable-auto-import[Disabling the automatic import of hosted clusters into {mce-short}].

*Important:* 

- Run the hub cluster and workers on the same platform for hosted control planes.

- Each hosted cluster must have a unique name in order for {mce-short} to manage it.

- A hosted cluster cannot be created in the namespace of a {mce-short} managed cluster.

[#create-hosted-clusters-prereqs-kubevirt]
== Prerequisites

You must meet the following prerequisites to create an {ocp-short} cluster on {ocp-virt-short}:

- You need administrator access to an {ocp-short} cluster, version 4.14 or later, specified by the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.
- The {ocp-short} managed cluster must have wildcard DNS routes enabled, as shown in the following DNS:

+
----
oc patch ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator default --type=json -p '[{ "op": "add", "path": "/spec/routeAdmission", "value": {wildcardPolicy: "WildcardsAllowed"}}]'
----
- The {ocp-short} managed cluster must have {ocp-virt-short}, version 4.14 or later, installed on it. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/virtualization/installing#installing-virt-web[Installing OpenShift Virtualization using the web console].
- The {ocp-short} managed cluster must be configured with OVNKubernetes as the default pod network CNI.
- The {ocp-short} managed cluster must have a default storage class. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/post-installation_configuration/post-install-storage-configuration[Post-installation storage configuration]. The following example shows how to set a default storage class:

+
----
oc patch storageclass ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
----
- You need a valid pull secret file for the `quay.io/openshift-release-dev` repository. For more information, see link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/platform-agnostic/user-provisioned[Install OpenShift on any x86_64 platform with user-provisioned infrastructure].
- You need to xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted_install_cli.adoc#hosted-install-cli[install the hosted control plane command line interface (hcp) binary].
- Before you can provision your cluster, you need to configure a load balancer. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosting_service_cluster_configure_metallb.adoc#hosting-service-cluster-configure-metallb-config[Optional: Configuring MetalLB].
