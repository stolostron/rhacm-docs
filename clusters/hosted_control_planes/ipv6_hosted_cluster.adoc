[#ipv6-hosted-cluster]
= Deploying the hosted cluster for an IPv6 network

A hosted cluster is an {ocp-short} cluster with its control plane and API endpoint hosted on a management cluster. The hosted cluster includes the control plane and its corresponding data plane.

Although you can use the console in {acm-short} to create a hosted cluster, the following procedures use manifests, which provide more flexibility for modifying the related artifacts.

[#ipv6-hosted-cluster-objects]
== Deploying hosted cluster objects

For the purposes of this procedure, the following values are used:

* HostedCluster name: `hosted-ipv6`
* HostedCluster namespace: `clusters`
* Disconnected: `true`
* Network stack: `IPv6`

Typically, the HyperShift Operator creates the `HostedControlPlane` namespace. However, in this case, you want to include all the objects before the HyperShift Operator begins to reconcile the `HostedCluster` object. Then, when the Operator starts the reconciliation process, it can find all of the objects in place.

. Create a YAML file with the following information about the namespaces:

+
[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: clusters-hosted-ipv6
spec: {}
status: {}
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: clusters

----

. Create a YAML file with the following information about the config maps and secrets to include in the `HostedCluster` deployment:

+

. Create a YAML file that contains the RBAC roles so that Assisted Service agents can be in the same `HostedControlPlane` namespace as the hosted control plane and still be managed by the cluster API:

A `NodePool` is a scalable set of worker nodes that is associated with a hosted cluster. `NodePool` machine architectures remain consistent within a specific pool and are independent of the machine architecture of the control plane.

<1> The `autoRepair` field is set to `false` because the node will not be re-created if it is removed.

<3> All of the nodes included in this `NodePool` are based on the following {ocp-short} version: `4.x.y-x86_64`. Replace `dns.base.domain.name` with the DNS base domain name and `4.x.y` with the supported {ocp-short} version you want to use.
<4> The `replicas` value is set to `0` so that you can scale them when needed. It is important to keep the `NodePool` replicas at 0 until all steps are completed.

The `InfraEnv` resource is an Assisted Service object that includes essential details, such as the `pullSecretRef` and the `sshAuthorizedKey`. Those details are used to create the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) boot image that is customized for the hosted cluster.

Next, create worker nodes.

[#ipv6-hosted-cluster-worker-nodes]
== Creating worker nodes for the hosted cluster

If you are working on a bare metal platform, creating worker nodes is crucial to ensure that the details in the `BareMetalHost` are correctly configured.

If you are working with virtual machines, you can complete the following steps to create empty worker nodes that the Metal3 Operator consumes. To do so, you use the `kcli` tool.

. If this is not your first attempt to create worker nodes, you must first delete your previous setup. To do so, delete the plan by entering the following command:

+
----
kcli delete plan hosted-ipv6
----

.. When you are prompted to confirm whether you want to delete the plan, type `y`.

.. Confirm that you see a message stating that the plan was deleted.

. Create the virtual machines by entering the following commands:

+
----
kcli create vm -P start=False -P uefi_legacy=true -P plan=hosted-ipv6 -P memory=8192 -P numcpus=16 -P disks=[200,200] -P nets=["{\"name\": \"ipv6\", \"mac\": \"aa:aa:aa:aa:02:11\"}"] -P uuid=aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaa0211 -P name=hosted-ipv6-worker0
----

----

+
----
systemctl restart ksushy
----

+
where:

* `start=False` means that the virtual machine (VM) will not automatically start upon creation.
* `uefi_legacy=true` means that you will use UEFI legacy boot to ensure compatibility with previous UEFI implementations.
* `plan=hosted-dual` indicates the plan name, which identifies a group of machines as a cluster.
* `memory=8192` and `numcpus=16` are parameters that specify the resources for the VM, including the RAM and CPU.
* `disks=[200,200]` indicates that you are creating two thin-provisioned disks in the VM.
* `nets=[{"name": "dual", "mac": "aa:aa:aa:aa:02:13"}]` are network details, including the network name to connect to and the MAC address of the primary interface.
* `restart ksushy` restarts the `ksushy` tool to ensure that the tool detects the VMs that you added.

. See the resulting output:

Next, create bare metal hosts for the hosted cluster.

[#ipv6-bmh-hosted-cluster]
== Creating bare metal hosts for the hosted cluster

A _bare metal host_ is an `openshift-machine-api` object that encompasses physical and logical details so that it can be identified by a Metal3 Operator. Those details are associated with other Assisted Service objects, known as _agents_.

*Important:* Before you create the bare metal host and destination nodes, you must create the virtual machines.

To create a bare metal host, complete the following steps:

. Create a YAML file with the following information:

+
*Note:* Because you have at least one secret that holds the bare metal host credentials, you need to create at least two objects for each worker node.

<1> `infraenvs.agent-install.openshift.io` serves as the link between the Assisted Installer and the `BareMetalHost` objects.
<2> `bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/hostname` represents the node name that is adopted during deployment.
<3> `automatedCleaningMode` prevents the node from being erased by the Metal3 Operator.
<4> `disableCertificateVerification` is set to `true` to bypass certificate validation from the client.
<5> `address` denotes the baseboard management controller (BMC) address of the worker node.
<6> `credentialsName` points to the secret where the user and password credentials are stored.
<7> `bootMACAddress` indicates the interface MAC address that the node starts from.
<8> `online` defines the state of the node after the `BareMetalHost` object is created.

. Deploy the `BareMetalHost` object by entering the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f 04-bmh.yaml

During the process, you can view the following output:

* This output indicates that the process is trying to reach the nodes:

. After the nodes start, notice the agents in the namespace, as shown in this example:

The agents represent nodes that are available for installation. To assign the nodes to a hosted cluster, scale up the node pool.

[#ipv6-scale-node-pool-hosted-cluster]
== Scaling up the node pool

After you create the bare metal hosts, their statuses change from `Registering` to `Provisioning` to `Provisioned`. The nodes start with the `LiveISO` of the agent and a default pod that is named `agent`. That agent is responsible for receiving instructions from the Assisted Service Operator to install the {ocp-short} payload.

. To scale up the node pool, enter the following command:

+
----
oc -n clusters scale nodepool hosted-ipv6 --replicas 3
----

. After the scaling process is complete, notice that the agents are assigned to a hosted cluster:

+
----
NAMESPACE         NAME                                   CLUSTER   APPROVED   ROLE          STAGE
clusters-hosted   aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaa0211   hosted    true       auto-assign
clusters-hosted   aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaa0212   hosted    true       auto-assign
clusters-hosted   aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaa0213   hosted    true       auto-assign
----

. Also notice that the node pool replicas are set:

+
----
NAMESPACE   NAME     CLUSTER   DESIRED NODES   CURRENT NODES   AUTOSCALING   AUTOREPAIR   VERSION             UPDATINGVERSION   UPDATINGCONFIG   MESSAGE
clusters    hosted   hosted    3                               False         False        4.x.y-x86_64                                           Minimum availability requires 3 replicas, current 0 available
----

. Wait until the nodes join the cluster. During the process, the agents provide updates on their stage and status.

Next, monitor the deployment of the hosted cluster.
