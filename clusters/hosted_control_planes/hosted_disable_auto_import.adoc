[#hosted-disable-auto-import]
= Disabling the automatic import of hosted clusters into {mce-short}

Starting with {mce-short} 2.4, hosted clusters are automatically imported into {mce-short} after the control plane becomes available. All {product-title-short} add-ons are also enabled if {product-title-short} is installed. Any hosted clusters that were previously imported are not affected, even if you disable automatic import. When you upgrade to {mce-short} 2.4 and automatic import is enabled, all hosted clusters that are not imported are automatically imported if their control planes are available.

If needed, you can disable the automatic import of hosted clusters. When automatic import is disabled, only newly created hosted clusters are not automatically imported. Hosted clusters that were already imported are not affected. You can still manually import clusters by using the console or by creating the `ManagedCluster` and `KlusterletAddonConfig` custom resources. For more information about manual import, see _Importing a hosted control plane cluster_.

To disable the automatic import of hosted clusters, complete the following steps:

. On the hub cluster, open the `hypershift-addon-deploy-config` specification that is in the `AddonDeploymentConfig` resource in the namespace where {mce-short} is installed by entering the following command:

+
----
oc edit addondeploymentconfig hypershift-addon-deploy-config -n multicluster-engine
----

. In the `spec.customizedVariables` section, add the `autoImportDisabled` variable with value of `"true"`, as shown in the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: AddOnDeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: hypershift-addon-deploy-config
  namespace: multicluster-engine
spec:
  customizedVariables:
   - name: hcMaxNumber
     value: "80"
  - name: hcThresholdNumber
    value: "60"
  - name: autoImportDisabled
    value: "true"
----

. To re-enable automatic import, set the value of the `autoImportDisabled` variable to `"false"` or remove the variable from the `AddonDeploymentConfig` resource.
