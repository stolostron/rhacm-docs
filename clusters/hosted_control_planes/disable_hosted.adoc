[#disable-hosted-control-planes]
= Disabling the hosted control plane feature

You can uninstall the the HyperShift Operator and disable the hosted control plane. When disabling the hosted control plane cluster feature, you must destroy the hosted cluster and the managed cluster resource on {mce-short}, as described in the _Managing hosted control plane clusters_ topics.

[#hypershift-uninstall-operator]
== Uninstalling the HyperShift Operator

To uninstall the HyperShift Operator and disable the `hypershift-addon` from the `local-cluster`, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command to ensure that there is no hosted cluster running:
+
----
oc get hostedcluster -A
----
+
*Important:* If a hosted cluster is running, the HyperShift Operator does not uninstall, even if the `hypershift-addon` is disabled.

. Disable the `hypershift-addon` by running the following command:
+
----
oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift-local-hosting","enabled": false}]}}}' <1>
----
+
<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`, but you can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the following command: `$ oc get mce`.
+
*Tip:* You can also disable the `hypershift-addon` for the `local-cluster` from the {mce-short} console after disabling the `hypershift-addon`.

[#hosted-disable-feature]
== Disabling the hosted control planes feature

You must first uninstall the HyperShift Operator before disabling the hosted control planes feature. Run the following command to disable the hosted control planes feature:

----
oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift","enabled": false}]}}}' <1>
----

<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`, but you can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the following command: `$ oc get mce`.

You can verify that the `hypershift` and `hypershift-local-hosting` features are disabled in the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource by running the following command:

----
oc get mce multiclusterengine -o yaml <1>
----

<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`, but you can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the following command: `$ oc get mce`.

See the following example where `hypershift` and `hypershift-local-hosting` have their `enabled:` flags set to `false`:
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine

  name: multiclusterengine
spec:

    components:
    - name: hypershift
      enabled: false
    - name: hypershift-local-hosting
      enabled: false
