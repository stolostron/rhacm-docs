[#disable-hosted-control-planes]
= Disabling the hosted control plane feature

You can uninstall the HyperShift Operator and disable the hosted control plane. When disabling the hosted control plane cluster feature, you must destroy the hosted cluster and the managed cluster resource on {mce-short}, as described in the _Managing hosted control plane clusters_ topics.

[#hypershift-uninstall-operator]
== Uninstalling the HyperShift Operator

To uninstall the HyperShift Operator and disable the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on from the `local-cluster` managed cluster, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command to ensure that you have no running hosted cluster:
+
----
oc get hostedcluster -A
----
+
*Important:* If a hosted cluster is running, the HyperShift Operator does not uninstall, even if `hypershift-addon` is disabled.

. Disable the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on by running the following command:
+
----
oc patch mce <multiclusterengine_instance_name> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift-local-hosting","enabled": false}]}}}' <1>
----
+
<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`. You can get the `MultiClusterEngine` instance name from your hosted cluster by running the `$ oc get mce` command.
+
*Tip:* You can also disable `hypershift-addon` for `local-cluster` from the {mce-short} console after disabling `hypershift-addon`.

[#hosted-disable-feature]
== Disabling the hosted control planes feature

You must first uninstall the HyperShift Operator before disabling the hosted control planes feature.

. Run the following command to disable the hosted control planes feature:

----
oc patch mce <multiclusterengine_instance_name> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift","enabled": false}]}}}' <1>
----

<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`. You can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your hosted cluster by running the `$ oc get mce` command.

. Verify that the `hypershift` and `hypershift-local-hosting` features are disabled in the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource by running the following command:

----
oc get mce <multiclusterengine_instance_name> -o yaml <1>
----

<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`. You can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the `$ oc get mce` command.

See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  overrides:
    components:
    - name: hypershift
      enabled: false <1>
    - name: hypershift-local-hosting
      enabled: false <2>
----

<1> The `enabled: false` field defines that the `hypershift` feature is disabled.
<2> The `enabled: false` field defines that the `hypershift-local-hosting` feature is disabled.
