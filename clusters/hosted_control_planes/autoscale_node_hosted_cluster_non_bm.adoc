[#enable-node-auto-scaling-hosted-cluster-non-bm]
= Enabling node auto-scaling for the hosted cluster

When you need more capacity in your hosted cluster and spare agents are available, you can enable auto-scaling to install new worker nodes.

. To enable auto-scaling, enter the following command. In this example, the minimum number of nodes is 2, and the maximum is 5. The maximum number of nodes that you can add might be bound by your platform. For example, if you use the Agent platform, the maximum number of nodes is bound by the number of available agents:

+
----
oc -n ${CLUSTERS_NAMESPACE} patch nodepool ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME} --type=json -p '[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/replicas"},{"op":"add", "path": "/spec/autoScaling", "value": { "max": 5, "min": 2 }}]'
----

. Create a workload that requires a new node.

.. Create a YAML file that contains the workload configuration by using in the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: reversewords
  name: reversewords
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 40
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reversewords
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: reversewords
  spec:
    containers:
    - image: quay.io/mavazque/reversewords:latest
      name: reversewords
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: 2Gi
status: {}
----

.. Save the file as `workload-config.yaml`.

.. Apply the YAML by entering the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f workload-config.yaml
----

. Extract the `hosted-admin-kubeconfig` secret by entering the following command:

+
----
oc extract -n clusters secret/hosted-admin-kubeconfig --to=./hostedcluster-secrets --confirm
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
hostedcluster-secrets/kubeconfig
----

. You can check if new nodes are in the `Ready` status by entering the following command:

+
----
oc --kubeconfig ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig get nodes
----

. To remove the node, delete the workload by entering the following command:

+
----
oc --kubeconfig ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig -n default delete deployment reversewords
----

. Wait for several minutes to pass without requiring the additional capacity. On the Agent platform, the agent is decommissioned and can be reused. You can confirm that the node was removed by entering the following command:

+
----
oc --kubeconfig ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig get nodes
----

[#disable-node-auto-scaling-hosted-cluster-non-bm]
== Disabling node auto-scaling for the hosted cluster

To disable node auto-scaling, enter the following command:

----
oc -n ${CLUSTERS_NAMESPACE} patch nodepool ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME} --type=json -p '[\{"op":"remove", "path": "/spec/autoScaling"}, \{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/replicas", "value": $SOME_INT_VALUE_FOR_SCALING_TO}]'
----

The command removes `"spec.autoScaling"` from the YAML file, adds `"spec.replicas"`, and sets `"spec.replicas"` to the value that you specify.
