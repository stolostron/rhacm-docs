[#ipv4-mce]
= Deploying {mce-short} for an IPv4 network

The {mce-short} plays a crucial role in deploying clusters across providers. If you already installed {acm-short}, you do not need to install {mce-short} because it is automatically installed.

If you do not have {mce-short} installed, review the following documentation to understand the prerequisites and steps to install it:

* xref:../about/mce_intro.adoc#mce-intro[About cluster lifecycle with multicluster engine operator]
* xref:../install_upgrade/install_intro.adoc#mce-install-intro[Installing and upgrading multicluster engine operator]

[#ipv4-mce-agent-service-config]
== Deploying `AgentServiceConfig` resources

The `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource is an essential component of the Assisted Service add-on that is part of {mce-short}. It is responsible for bare metal cluster deployment. When the add-on is enabled, you deploy the `AgentServiceConfig` resource to configure the add-on.

In addition to configuring the `AgentServiceConfig` resource, you need to include additional config maps to ensure that {mce-short} functions properly in a disconnected environment.

. Configure the custom registries by adding the following config map, which contains the disconnected details to customize the deployment:

+
[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: custom-registries
  namespace: multicluster-engine
  labels:
    app: assisted-service
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  registries.conf: |
    unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]

    [[registry]]
    prefix = ""
    location = "registry.redhat.io/openshift4"
    mirror-by-digest-only = true

    [[registry.mirror]]
      location = "registry.dns.base.domain.name:5000/openshift4" <1>

    [[registry]]
    prefix = ""
    location = "registry.redhat.io/rhacm2"
    mirror-by-digest-only = true
    ...
    ...
----

+
<1> Replace `_dns.base.domain.name_` with the DNS base domain name.

+
The object contains two fields:

* Custom CAs: This field contains the Certificate Authorities (CAs) that are loaded into the various processes of the deployment.
* Registries: The `Registries.conf` field contains information about images and namespaces that need to be consumed from a mirror registry rather than the original source registry.

. Configure the Assisted Service by adding the `AssistedServiceConfig` object, as shown in the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
  annotations:
    unsupported.agent-install.openshift.io/assisted-service-configmap: assisted-service-config <1>
  name: agent
  namespace: multicluster-engine
spec:
  mirrorRegistryRef:
    name: custom-registries <2>
  databaseStorage:
    storageClassName: lvms-vg1
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
  filesystemStorage:
    storageClassName: lvms-vg1
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 20Gi
  osImages: <3>
  - cpuArchitecture: x86_64
    openshiftVersion: "4.14"
    rootFSUrl: http://registry.dns.base.domain.name:8080/images/rhcos-414.92.202308281054-0-live-rootfs.x86_64.img <4>
    url: http://registry.dns.base.domain.name:8080/images/rhcos-414.92.202308281054-0-live.x86_64.iso
    version: 414.92.202308281054-0
----

+
<1> The `metadata.annotations["unsupported.agent-install.openshift.io/assisted-service-configmap"]` annotation references the config map name that the Operator consumes to customize behavior.
<2> The `spec.mirrorRegistryRef.name` annotation points to the config map that contains disconnected registry information that the Assisted Service Operator consumes. This config map adds those resources during the deployment process.
<3> The `spec.osImages` field contains different versions available for deployment by this Operator. This field is mandatory. This example assumes that you already downloaded the `RootFS` and `LiveISO` files.
<4> In the `rootFSUrl` and `url` fields, replace `_dns.base.domain.name_` with the DNS base domain name.

. Deploy all of the objects by concatenating them into a single file and applying them to the management cluster. To do so, enter the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f agentServiceConfig.yaml
----

+
The command triggers two pods, as shown in this example output:

+
----
assisted-image-service-0                               1/1     Running   2             11d <1>
assisted-service-668b49548-9m7xw                       2/2     Running   5             11d <2>
----

+
<1> The `assisted-image-service` pod is responsible for creating the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) boot image template, which is customized for each cluster that you deploy.
<2> The `assisted-service` refers to the Operator.
