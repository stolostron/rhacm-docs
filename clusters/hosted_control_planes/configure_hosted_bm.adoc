[#configuring-hosting-service-cluster-configure-bm]
= Configuring the hosting cluster on bare metal

You can deploy hosted control planes by configuring a cluster to function as a hosting cluster. The hosting cluster is the {ocp-short} cluster where the control planes are hosted. The hosting cluster is also known as the _management_ cluster. 

*Note:* The management cluster is not the same thing as the _managed_ cluster. A managed cluster is a cluster that the hub cluster manages.

You can enable a managed cluster to be a hosting cluster by using the `hypershift` add-on to deploy the HyperShift Operator on that cluster. Then, you can start to create the hosted cluster. 

The {mce-short} 2.2 supports only the default `local-cluster`, which is a hub cluster that is managed, and the hub cluster as the hosting cluster.

Hosted control planes is a Technology Preview feature, so the related components are disabled by default. 

On {product-title-short} 2.7, you can use the managed hub cluster, also known as the `local-cluster`, as the hosting cluster.

*Important:* 

- Run the hub cluster and workers on the same platform for hosted control planes.

- To provision hosted control planes on bare metal, you can use the Agent platform. The Agent platform uses the Central Infrastructure Management (CIM) service to add worker nodes to a hosted cluster. For an introduction to the CIM service, see link:https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service/blob/master/docs/hive-integration/kube-api-getting-started.md[Kube API - Getting Started Guide].

- Each bare metal host must be started with a Discovery Image that the CIM provides. You can start the hosts manually or through automation by using `Cluster-Baremetal-Operator`. After each host starts, it runs an Agent process to discover the host details and complete the installation. An `Agent` custom resource represents each host.

- When you create a hosted cluster with the Agent platform, HyperShift installs the Agent Cluster API provider in the hosted control plane namespace.

- When you scale up a node pool, a machine is created. The Cluster API provider finds an Agent that is approved, is passing validations, is not currently in use, and meets the requirements that are specified in the node pool specification. You can monitor the installation of an Agent by checking its status and conditions.

- When you scale down a node pool, Agents are unbound from the corresponding cluster. Before you can reuse the clusters, you must restart them by using the Discovery image to update the number of nodes.

[#hosting-service-cluster-configure-prereq]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites to configure a hosting cluster: 

* You need the {mce} 2.2 and later installed on an {ocp-short} cluster. The {mce-short} is automatically installed when you install {product-title-short}. You can also install {mce-short} without {product-title-short} as an Operator from the {ocp-short} OperatorHub.

* You need the {mce-short} must have at least one managed {ocp-short} cluster. The `local-cluster` is automatically imported in {mce-short} 2.2 and later. See xref:../install_upgrade/adv_config_install.adoc#advanced-config-engine[Advanced configuration] for more information about the `local-cluster`. You can check the status of your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get managedclusters local-cluster
----

* You need a hosting cluster with at least 3 worker nodes to run the HyperShift Operator.

* You need to enable Central Infrastructure Management (CIM). For more information, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/create_infra_env.adoc#enable-cim[Enabling the Central Infrastructure Management service].
//same here
* You need to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#hosted-install-cli[install the hosted control plane command line interface (hcp) binary].

[#infrastructure-reqs-bare-metal]
== Bare metal infrastructure requirements

The Agent platform does not create any infrastructure, but it does have the following requirements for infrastructure:

* Agents: An _Agent_ represents a host that is booted with a discovery image and is ready to be provisioned as an {ocp-short} node.

* DNS: The API and Ingress endpoints must be routable.

* The hosted control planes feature is enabled by default. To disable the hosted control planes feature or, if you already disabled it and want to manually enable it, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/enable_or_disable_hosted.adoc#enable-or-disable-hosted-control-planes[Enabling or disabling the hosted control planes feature].

* To manage hosted clusters by running {aap} jobs, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/ansible_config_hosted_cluster.adoc#ansible-config-hosted-cluster[Configuring {aap-short} jobs to run on hosted clusters].
