= Configuring DNS for a dual stack network

This step is mandatory for both disconnected and connected environments in both virtual and bare metal environments. The key distinction between virtual and bare metal environment lies in the location where you configure the resources. In a non-virtual environment, use a solution like Bind rather than a lightweight solution like `dnsmasq`.

* To configure DNS for a dual stack network on a virtual environment, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/config_ingress_dns_kubevirt.adoc#create-hosted-clusters-kubevirt-default-ingress-dns[Default ingress and DNS behavior].

* To configure DNS for a dual stack network on bare metal, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/config_dns_bm.adoc#configure-dns-bm[Configuring DNS on bare metal].

Next, deploy a registry.
