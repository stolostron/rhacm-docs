[#enable-or-disable-hosted-control-planes]
= Enabling or disabling the hosted control plane feature

The hosted control planes feature, as well as the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on, are enabled by default. If you want to disable the feature, or if you disabled it and want to manually enable it, see the following procedures:

* <<hosted-enable-feature,Manually enabling the hosted control planes feature>>
* <<disable-hosted-control-planes,Disabling the hosted control planes feature>>

[#hosted-enable-feature]
== Manually enabling the hosted control planes feature

. You can run the following command to enable the feature:
+
----
oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift","enabled": true}]}}}' <1>
----
<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`, but you can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the following command: `$ oc get mce`.

. Run the following command to verify that the `hypershift` and `hypershift-local-hosting` features are enabled in the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource:
+
----
oc get mce multiclusterengine -o yaml <1>
----
<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`, but you can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the following command: `$ oc get mce`.
+
The output resembles the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  overrides:
    components:
    - name: hypershift
      enabled: true
    - name: hypershift-local-hosting
      enabled: true

[#hosted-enable-hypershift-add-on-aws]
=== Manually enabling the hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on for local-cluster

Enabling the hosted control planes feature automatically enables the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on. If you need to enable the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on manually, complete the following steps to use the `hypershift-addon` to install the HyperShift Operator on `local-cluster`:

. Create the `ManagedClusterAddon` HyperShift add-on by creating a file that resembles the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  name: hypershift-addon
  namespace: local-cluster 
spec:
  installNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

. Apply the file by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f <filename>
----
+
Replace `filename` with the name of the file that you created. 

. Confirm that the `hypershift-addon` is installed by running the following command:
+
----
oc get managedclusteraddons -n local-cluster hypershift-addon
----
+
If the add-on is installed, the output resembles the following example:
+
----
NAME               AVAILABLE   DEGRADED   PROGRESSING
hypershift-addon   True
----

Your HyperShift add-on is installed and the hosting cluster is available to create and manage hosted clusters.

[#disable-hosted-control-planes]
== Disabling the hosted control planes feature

You can uninstall the the HyperShift Operator and disable the hosted control plane. When you disable the hosted control plane cluster feature, you must destroy the hosted cluster and the managed cluster resource on {mce-short}, as described in the _Managing hosted control plane clusters_ topics.

[#hypershift-uninstall-operator]
=== Uninstalling the HyperShift Operator

To uninstall the HyperShift Operator and disable the `hypershift-addon` from the `local-cluster`, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command to ensure that there is no hosted cluster running:
+
----
oc get hostedcluster -A
----
+
*Important:* If a hosted cluster is running, the HyperShift Operator does not uninstall, even if the `hypershift-addon` is disabled.

. Disable the `hypershift-addon` by running the following command:
+
----
oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift-local-hosting","enabled": false}]}}}' <1>
----
+
<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`, but you can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the following command: `$ oc get mce`.
+
*Note:* You can also disable the `hypershift-addon` for the `local-cluster` from the {mce-short} console after disabling the `hypershift-addon`.

[#hosted-disable-feature]
=== Disabling the hosted control planes feature

You must first uninstall the HyperShift Operator before disabling the hosted control planes feature. Run the following command to disable the hosted control planes feature:

----
oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift","enabled": false}]}}}' <1>
----

<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`, but you can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the following command: `$ oc get mce`.

You can verify that the `hypershift` and `hypershift-local-hosting` features are disabled in the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource by running the following command:

----
oc get mce multiclusterengine -o yaml <1>
----

<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`, but you can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the following command: `$ oc get mce`.

See the following example where `hypershift` and `hypershift-local-hosting` have their `enabled:` flags set to `false`:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  overrides:
    components:
    - name: hypershift
      enabled: false
    - name: hypershift-local-hosting
      enabled: false
