= Deploying a hosted cluster on AWS

After you set up the hosted control plane command line interface, `hcp`, and enable the `local-cluster` as the hosting cluster, you can deploy a hosted cluster on AWS by completing the following steps. To deploy a private hosted cluster, see _Deploying a private hosted cluster on AWS_.

. Set environment variables as follows, replacing variables as needed with your credentials:

+
----
export REGION=us-east-1
export CLUSTER_NAME=clc-name-hs1
export INFRA_ID=clc-name-hs1
export BASE_DOMAIN=dev09.red-chesterfield.com
export AWS_CREDS=$HOME/name-aws
export PULL_SECRET=/Users/username/pull-secret.txt
export BUCKET_NAME=acmqe-hypershift
export BUCKET_REGION=us-east-1
----

+
. Verify that `CLUSTER_NAME` and `INFRA_ID` have the same values, otherwise the cluster might not appear correctly in the {mce} console. To see descriptions for each variable, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
hcp create cluster aws --help
----

. Verify that you are logged into your hub cluster.

. Run the following command to create the hosted cluster:

+
[source,bash]
----
hcp create cluster aws \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --infra-id $INFRA_ID \
    --base-domain $BASE_DOMAIN \
    --aws-creds $AWS_CREDS \
    --pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
    --region $REGION \
    --generate-ssh \
    --node-pool-replicas 3 \
    --namespace <hypershift-hosting-service-cluster>
----

+
*Note:* By default, all `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` custom resources are created in the `clusters` namespace. If you specify the `--namespace <namespace>` parameter, `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` custom resources are created in the namespace you chose.

. You can check the status of your hosted cluster by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get hostedclusters -n <hypershift-hosting-service-cluster>
----

. You can check your node pools by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get nodepools --namespace clusters
----
