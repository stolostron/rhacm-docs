[#hosted-control-planes-manage-aws]
= Managing hosted control plane clusters on AWS (Technology Preview)

You can use the {mce} console to create a {ocp} hosted cluster. Hosted control planes are available as a Technology Preview on Amazon Web Services (AWS). If you use hosted control planes on AWS, you can create a hosted cluster by using the console, or you can import a hosted cluster by using either the console or the CLI.

[#hosted-prerequisites-aws]
== Prerequisites

You must configure hosted control planes before you can create hosted control plane clusters. See xref:../../clusters/hosted_control_planes/configure_hosted_aws.adoc#hosting-service-cluster-configure-aws[Configuring hosted control planes (Technology Preview)] for more information.

[#create-hosted-aws]
== Creating a hosted control plane cluster on AWS with the console

To create a hosted control plane cluster from the {mce-short} console, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. On the _Clusters_ page, click *Create cluster* > *Host inventory* > *Hosted* and complete the steps in the console. 

*Important:* When you create a cluster, the {mce-short} controller creates a namespace for the cluster and its resources. Ensure that you include only resources for that cluster instance in that namespace. Destroying the cluster deletes the namespace and all of the resources in it.

Select *YAML: On* to view content updates as you enter the information in the console.

If you want to add your cluster to an existing cluster set, you must have the correct permissions on the cluster set to add it. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges when you are creating the cluster, you must select a cluster set on which you have `clusterset-admin` permissions. If you do not have the correct permissions on the specified cluster set, the cluster creation fails. Contact your cluster administrator to provide you with `clusterset-admin` permissions if you do not have any cluster set options to select.

Every managed cluster must be associated with a managed cluster set. If you do not assign the managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

The release image identifies the version of the {ocp-short} image that is used to create the cluster. Hosted control plane clusters must use one of the provided release images.

Proxy information that is provided in the infrastructure environment is automatically added to the proxy fields. You can use the existing information, overwrite it, or add the information if you want to enable a proxy. The following list contains the required information for creating a proxy: 

* HTTP proxy URL: The URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

* HTTPS proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.

* No proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add an asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

* Additional trust bundle: The contents of the certificate file that is required to access the mirror registry.
  
When you review your information and optionally customize it before creating the cluster, you can select *YAML: On* to view the YAML content in the panel. You can edit the YAML file with your custom settings, if you have any updates.  

*Note:* You have to run the `oc` command that is provided with the cluster details to import the cluster. When you create the cluster, it is not automatically configured with the management of {product-title-short}.

[#hosted-deploy-cluster-aws]
== Deploying a hosted cluster on AWS

After setting up the HyperShift command line interface and enabling the `local-cluster` as the hosting cluster, you can deploy a hosted cluster on AWS by completing the following steps:

. Set environment variables as follows, replacing variables as needed with your credentials:
+
----
export REGION=us-east-1
export CLUSTER_NAME=clc-name-hs1
export INFRA_ID=clc-name-hs1
export BASE_DOMAIN=dev09.red-chesterfield.com
export AWS_CREDS=$HOME/name-aws
export PULL_SECRET=/Users/username/pull-secret.txt
export BUCKET_NAME=acmqe-hypershift
export BUCKET_REGION=us-east-1
----
+
. Verify that `CLUSTER_NAME` and `INFRA_ID` have the same values, otherwise the cluster might not appear correctly in the {mce} console. To see descriptions for each variable, run the following command
+
----
hypershift create cluster aws --help
----

. Verify that you are logged into your hub cluster.

. Run the following command to create the hosted cluster:
+
----
hypershift create cluster aws \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --infra-id $INFRA_ID \
    --aws-creds $AWS_CREDS \
    --pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
    --region $REGION \
    --generate-ssh \
    --node-pool-replicas 3 \
    --namespace <hypershift-hosting-service-cluster>
----
+
*Note:* By default, all `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` custom resources are created in the `clusters` namespace. If you specify the `--namespace <namespace>` parameter, `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` custom resources are created in the namespace you chose.

. You can check the status of your hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get hostedclusters -n <hypershift-hosting-service-cluster>
----

[#importing-hosted-cluster-ui-aws]
=== Importing a hosted control plane cluster on AWS with the console

You can import a hosted control plane cluster with the console by navigating to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters* and selecting the hosted cluster you want to import. Then, click *Import hosted cluster*.

*Note:* For your _discovered_ hosted cluster, you can also import from the console, but the cluster must be in an upgradable state. Import on your cluster is disabled if the hosted cluster is not in an upgradable state because the hosted control plane is not available. Click *Import* to begin the process. The status is `Importing` while the cluster receives updates and then changes to `Ready`.

[#importing-hosted-cluster-cli-aws]
== Importing a hosted control plane cluster on AWS with the CLI

You can import a hosted control cluster with the CLI by completing the following steps:

. Add an annotation to the `HostedCluster` custom resource by running the following command:
+
----
oc edit hostedcluster <cluster_name> -n clusters
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Run the following command to add the annotations to the `HostedCluster` custom resource:
+
----
cluster.open-cluster-management.io/hypershiftdeployment: local-cluster/<cluster_name>
cluster.open-cluster-management.io/managedcluster-name: <cluster_name>
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Create your `ManagedCluster` resource by using the following sample YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:  
  annotations:    
    import.open-cluster-management.io/hosting-cluster-name: local-cluster    
    import.open-cluster-management.io/klusterlet-deploy-mode: Hosted
    open-cluster-management/created-via: other  
  labels:    
    cloud: auto-detect    
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: default    
    name: <cluster_name>  
    vendor: OpenShift  
  name: <cluster_name>
spec:  
  hubAcceptsClient: true  
  leaseDurationSeconds: 60
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Run the following command to apply the resource:
+
----
oc apply -f <file_name>
----
+
Replace <file_name> with the YAML file name you created in the previous step.

. Create your `KlusterletAddonConfig` resource by using the following sample YAML file. This only applies to {product-title-short}. If you have installed {mce-short} only, skip this step:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: KlusterletAddonConfig
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name>
  namespace: <cluster_name>
spec:
  clusterName: <cluster_name>
  clusterNamespace: <cluster_name>
  clusterLabels:
    cloud: auto-detect
    vendor: auto-detect
  applicationManager:
    enabled: true
  certPolicyController:
    enabled: true
  iamPolicyController:
    enabled: true
  policyController:
    enabled: true
  searchCollector:
    enabled: false
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Run the following command to apply the resource:
+
----
oc apply -f <file_name>
----
+
Replace <file_name> with the YAML file name you created in the previous step.

. After the import process is complete, your hosted cluster becomes visible in the console. You can also check the status of your hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get managedcluster <cluster_name>
----

[#hosting-service-cluster-access-aws]
== Accessing a hosting cluster on AWS

The access secrets for hosted control plane clusters are stored in the `hypershift-management-cluster` namespace. Learn about the following secret name formats:

- `kubeconfig` secret: `<hostingNamespace>-<name>-admin-kubeconfig` (clusters-hypershift-demo-admin-kubeconfig)
- `kubeadmin` password secret: `<hostingNamespace>-<name>-kubeadmin-password` (clusters-hypershift-demo-kubeadmin-password)

[#hypershift-cluster-destroy-aws]
== Destroying a hosted cluster on AWS

To destroy a hosted cluster and its managed cluster resource, complete the following steps:

. Delete the hosted cluster and its back-end resources by running the following command:
+
----
hypershift destroy cluster aws --name <cluster_name> --infra-id <infra_id> --aws-creds <aws-credentials> --base-domain <base_domain> --destroy-cloud-resources
----
+
Replace names where necessary.

. Delete the managed cluster resource on {mce-short} by running the following command:
+
----
oc delete managedcluster <cluster_name>
----
+
Replace `cluster_name` with the name of your cluster.
