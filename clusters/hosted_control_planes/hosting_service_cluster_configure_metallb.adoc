You must use a load balancer, such as MetalLB. The following example shows the steps you can take to configure MetalLB after you install it. For more information about installing MetalLB, see _Installing the MetalLB Operator_ in the {ocp-short} documentation.

. Create a `MetalLB` resource instance:

+
----
oc create -f - 
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: MetalLB
metadata:
  name: metallb
  namespace: metallb-system
----

. Create an address pool with an available range of IP addresses within the node network. Replace the following IP address ranges with an unused pool of available IP addresses in your network. Enter the following command:

+
----
oc create -f - 
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: metallb
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.216.32-192.168.216.122
----

. Advertise the address pool by using L2 protocol. Enter the following command:

+
----
oc create -f -
