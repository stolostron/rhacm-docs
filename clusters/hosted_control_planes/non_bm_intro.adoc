[#configuring-hosting-service-cluster-configure-agent-non-bm]
= Configuring hosted control plane clusters using non bare metal agent machines (Tech Preview)

You can deploy hosted control planes by configuring a cluster to function as a hosting cluster. The hosting cluster is the {ocp-short} cluster where the control planes are hosted. The hosting cluster is also known as the _management_ cluster.

*Note:* The management cluster is not the same thing as the _managed_ cluster. A managed cluster is a cluster that the hub cluster manages.

The hosted control planes feature is enabled by default.

The {mce-short} 2.4 supports only the default `local-cluster`, which is a hub cluster that is managed, and the hub cluster as the hosting cluster. On {product-title-short} 2.9, you can use the managed hub cluster, also known as the `local-cluster`, as the hosting cluster.

A _hosted cluster_ is an {ocp-short} cluster with its API endpoint and control plane that are hosted on the hosting cluster. The hosted cluster includes the control plane and its corresponding data plane. You can use the {mce-short} console or the hosted control plane command line interface, `hcp`, to create a hosted cluster. The hosted cluster is automatically imported as a managed cluster. If you want to disable this automatic import feature, see _Disabling the automatic import of hosted clusters into {mce-short}_.

*Important:*

- Each hosted cluster must have a unique name in order for {mce-short} to manage it.

- Run the hub cluster and workers on the same platform for hosted control planes.

- A hosted cluster cannot be created in the namespace of a {mce-short} managed cluster.

- You can add agent machines as a worker node to a hosted cluster by using the Agent platform. Agent machine represents a host booted with a Discovery Image and ready to be provisioned as an {ocp-short} node. The Agent platform is part of the central infrastructure management service. For more information, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/cim_enable.adoc#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

- All hosts that are not bare metal require a manual boot with a Discovery Image ISO that the central infrastructure management provides.

- When you create a hosted cluster with the Agent platform, HyperShift installs the Agent Cluster API provider in the hosted control plane namespace.

- When you scale up the node pool, a machine is created for every replica. For every machine, the Cluster API provider finds and installs an Agent that is approved, is passing validations, is not currently in use, and meets the requirements that are specified in the node pool specification. You can monitor the installation of an Agent by checking its status and conditions.

- When you scale down a node pool, Agents are unbound from the corresponding cluster. Before you can reuse the Agents, you must restart them by using the Discovery image.

- When you configure storage for hosted control planes, consider the recommended etcd practices. To ensure that you meet the latency requirements, dedicate a fast storage device to all hosted control plane etcd instances that run on each control-plane node. You can use LVM storage to configure a local storage class for hosted etcd pods. For more information, see _Recommended etcd practices_ and _Persistent storage using logical volume manager storage_ in the {ocp-short} documentation.

[#hosting-service-cluster-configure-prereq-non-bm]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites to configure a hosting cluster:

* You need the {mce} 2.4 and later installed on an {ocp-short} cluster. The {mce-short} is automatically installed when you install {product-title-short}. You can also install {mce-short} without {product-title-short} as an Operator from the {ocp-short} OperatorHub.

* The {mce-short} must have at least one managed {ocp-short} cluster. The `local-cluster` is automatically imported in {mce-short} 2.4 and later. See xref:../install_upgrade/adv_config_install.adoc#advanced-config-engine[Advanced configuration] for more information about the `local-cluster`. You can check the status of your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get managedclusters local-cluster
----

* You need to enable central infrastructure management. For more information, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/cim_enable.adoc#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

* You need to xref:../hosted_control_planes/install_hcp_cli.adoc#hosted-install-cli[install the hosted control plane command line interface].

[#firewall-port-reqs-non-bare-metal]
== Firewall and port requirements for non bare metal agent machines

Ensure that you meet the firewall and port requirements so that ports can communicate between the management cluster, the control plane, and hosted clusters:

* The `kube-apiserver` service runs on port 6443 by default and requires ingress access for communication between the control plane components.

** If you use the `NodePort` publishing strategy, ensure that the node port that is assigned to the `kube-apiserver` service is exposed.
** If you use MetalLB load balancing, allow ingress access to the IP range that is used for load balancer IP addresses.

* If you use the `NodePort` publishing strategy, use a firewall rule for the `ignition-server` and `Oauth-server` settings.

* The `konnectivity` agent, which establishes a reverse tunnel to allow bi-directional communication on the hosted cluster, requires egress access to the cluster API server address on port 6443. With that egress access, the agent can reach the `kube-apiserver` service.

** If the cluster API server address is an internal IP address, allow access from the workload subnets to the IP address on port 6443.
** If the address is an external IP address, allow egress on port 6443 to that external IP address from the nodes.

* If you change the default port of 6443, adjust the rules to reflect that change.
* Ensure that you open any ports that are required by the workloads that run in the clusters.
* Use firewall rules, security groups, or other access controls to restrict access to only required sources. Avoid exposing ports publicly unless necessary.
* For production deployments, use a load balancer to simplify access through a single IP address.

[#infrastructure-reqs-nonbare-metal]
== Infrastructure requirements for non bare metal agent machines

The Agent platform does not create any infrastructure, but it does have the following requirements for infrastructure:

* Agents: An _Agent_ represents a host that is booted with a discovery image and is ready to be provisioned as an {ocp-short} node.

* DNS: The API and ingress endpoints must be routable.
