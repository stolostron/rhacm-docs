[#override-resource-utilization-measurements]
= Overriding resource utilization measurements

The set of baseline measurements for resource utilization can vary in every cluster. Fore more information, see _Hosted control plane sizing guidance_.

You can override the resource utilization measurements based on the type and pace of your cluster workload. Complete the following steps:

. Create the `ConfigMap` resource by running the following command:

+
----
oc create -f <your-config-map-file.yaml>
----
+
Replace `<your-config-map-file.yaml>` with the name of your YAML file that contains your `hcp-sizing-baseline` config map.

. Create the `hcp-sizing-baseline` config map in the `local-cluster` namespace to specify the measurements you want to override. Your config map might resemble the following YAML file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: hcp-sizing-baseline
  namespace: local-cluster
data:
  incrementalCPUUsagePer1KQPS: "9.0"
  memoryRequestPerHCP: "18"
  minimumQPSPerHCP: "50.0"
----

. Delete the `hypershift-addon-agent` deployment to restart the `hypershift-addon-agent` pod by running the following command:

+
----
oc delete deployment hypershift-addon-agent -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

. Observe the `hypershift-addon-agent` pod logs. Verify that the overridden measurements are updated in the config map by running the following command:

+
----
oc logs hypershift-addon-agent -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

+
Your logs might resemble the following output:

+
----

+
If the overridden measurements are not updated properly in the `hcp-sizing-baseline` config map, you might see the following error message in the `hypershift-addon-agent` pod logs:
+
----
2024-01-05T19:53:54.052Z	ERROR	agent.agent-reconciler	agent/agent.go:788	failed to get configmap from the hub. Setting the HCP sizing baseline with default values.	{"error": "configmaps \"hcp-sizing-baseline\" not found"}

[#hosted-disable-metrics-monitoring]
== Disabling the metric service monitoring

After enabling the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster addon, the metric service monitoring is configured by default so that {ocp-short} monitoring can gather metrics from `hypershift-addon`. You can disable the metric service monitoring by completing the following steps:

. Log in to your hub cluster by running the following command:

+
----
oc login
----

. Open the `hypershift-addon-deploy-config` add-on deployment configuration specification for editing by running the following command:

+
----
oc edit addondeploymentconfig hypershift-addon-deploy-config -n multicluster-engine
----

. Add the `disableMetrics=true` customized variable to the specification, as shown in the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: AddOnDeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: hypershift-addon-deploy-config
  namespace: multicluster-engine
spec:
  customizedVariables:
  - name: hcMaxNumber
    value: "80"
  - name: hcThresholdNumber
    value: "60"
  - name: disableMetrics
    value: "true"
----

. Save the changes. The `disableMetrics=true` customized variable disables the metric service monitoring configuration for both new and existing `hypershift-addon` managed cluster addons.
