[#enable-node-auto-scaling-hosted-cluster]
= Enabling node auto-scaling for the hosted cluster

When you need more capacity in your hosted cluster and spare agents are available, you can enable auto-scaling to install new worker nodes. 

. To enable auto-scaling, enter the following command. In this case, the minimum number of nodes is 2, and the maximum is 5. The maximum number of nodes that you can add might be bound by your platform. For example, if you use the Agent platform, the maximum number of nodes is bound by the number of available agents.

+
----
oc -n ${CLUSTERS_NAMESPACE} patch nodepool ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME} --type=json -p '[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/replicas"},{"op":"add", "path": "/spec/autoScaling", "value": { "max": 5, "min": 2 }}]'
----

+
If 10 minutes pass without requiring the additional capacity, the worker node is removed. On the Agent platform, the agent is decommissioned and can be reused.

. Create a workload that requires a new node.

.. Create a YAML file that contains the workload configuration, as shown in the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: reversewords
  name: reversewords
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 40
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reversewords
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: reversewords
  spec:
    containers:
    - image: quay.io/mavazque/reversewords:latest
      name: reversewords
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: 2Gi
status: {}
----

.. Save the file as `workload-config.yaml`.

.. Apply the YAML by entering the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f workload-config.yaml 
----

. If you check the nodes by entering the following command, the new node is displayed in the output. In this example, `ocp-worker-0` is added to the cluster:

+
----
oc --kubeconfig ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig get nodes
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
NAME           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ocp-worker-0   Ready    worker   35s   v1.24.0+3882f8f
ocp-worker-1   Ready    worker   40m   v1.24.0+3882f8f
ocp-worker-2   Ready    worker   41m   v1.24.0+3882f8f
----

. To remove the node, delete the workload by entering the following command:

+
----
oc --kubeconfig ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig -n default delete deployment reversewords
----

. Wait 10 minutes and then confirm that the node was removed by entering the following command:

+
----
oc --kubeconfig ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig get nodes
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
NAME           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ocp-worker-1   Ready    worker   51m   v1.24.0+3882f8f
ocp-worker-2   Ready    worker   52m   v1.24.0+3882f8f

[#disable-node-auto-scaling-hosted-cluster]
== Disabling node auto-scaling for the hosted cluster

To disable node auto-scaling, enter the following command:

----
oc -n ${CLUSTERS_NAMESPACE} patch nodepool ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME} --type=json -p '[\{"op":"remove", "path": "/spec/autoScaling"}, \{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/replicas", "value": $SOME_INT_VALUE_FOR_SCALING_TO}]'
----

The command removes `"spec.autoScaling"`` from the YAML file, adds `"spec.replicas"`, and sets `"spec.replicas"` to the value that you specify.
