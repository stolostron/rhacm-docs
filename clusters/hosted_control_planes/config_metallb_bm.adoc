= Optional: Configuring MetalLB

You must use a load balancer, such as MetalLB. The following example shows the steps you can take to configure MetalLB after you install it. For more information about installing MetalLB, see _Installing the MetalLB Operator_ in the {ocp-short} documentation.

. Create a `MetalLB` resource by saving the following sample YAML content in the `configure-metallb.yaml` file:

+
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: MetalLB
metadata:
  name: metallb
  namespace: metallb-system
----

. Apply the YAML content by entering the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f configure-metallb.yaml
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
metallb.metallb.io/metallb created
----

. Create a `IPAddressPool` resource by saving the following sample YAML content in the `create-ip-address-pool.yaml` file:

+
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: metallb
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.216.32-192.168.216.122<1>
----
+
<1> Create an address pool with an available range of IP addresses within the node network. Replace the IP address range with an unused pool of available IP addresses in your network.


. Apply the YAML content by entering the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f create-ip-address-pool.yaml
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
ipaddresspool.metallb.io/metallb created
----

. Create a `L2Advertisement` resource by saving the following sample YAML content in the `l2advertisement.yaml` file:

+
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: l2advertisement
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
   - metallb
----

. Apply the YAML content by entering the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f l2advertisement.yaml
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
l2advertisement.metallb.io/metallb created
----
