= Configuring hosted control planes on an IPv4 network

IPv4 is one of the simplest network configurations to deploy hosted control planes in a disconnected environment. IPv4 ranges require fewer external components than IPv6 or dual-stack setups.

The process to configure hosted control planes on an IPv4 network involves the following steps, which are described in detail in the sections that follow:  

. Configure the hypervisor for an IPv4 network
. Configuring DNS for an IPv4 network
. Deploying a registry for an IPv4 network
. Setting up a management cluster for an IPv4 network
. Configuring the web server for an IPv4 network
. Configuring image mirroring for an IPv4 network
. Deploying {mce-short} for an IPv4 network
. Configuring TLS certificates for an IPv4 network
. Deploying the hosted cluster for an IPv4 network
. Finishing the deployment for an IPv4 network
