[#hosting-service-cluster-configure-aws]
= Configuring hosted control plane clusters on AWS (Technology Preview)

To configure hosted control planes, you need a hosting cluster and a hosted cluster. By deploying the HyperShift Operator on an existing managed cluster by using the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on, you can enable that cluster as a hosting cluster and start to create the hosted cluster. The `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on is enabled by default for the `local-cluster` managed cluster in the {mce-short} 2.4 and {product-title-short} 2.9 hub cluster.

A _hosted cluster_ is an {ocp-short} cluster with its API endpoint and control plane that are hosted on the hosting cluster. The hosted cluster includes the control plane and its corresponding data plane. You can use the {mce-short} console or the hosted control plane command line interface, `hcp`, to create a hosted cluster. The hosted cluster is automatically imported as a managed cluster. If you want to disable this automatic import feature, see _Disabling the automatic import of hosted clusters into {mce-short}_.

*Important:*

- Each hosted cluster must have a unique name in order for {mce-short} to manage it.

- Run the hub cluster and workers on the same platform for hosted control planes.

- Each hosted cluster must have a unique name in order for {mce-short} to manage it.

- A hosted cluster cannot be created in the namespace of a {mce-short} managed cluster.

== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites to configure a hosting cluster:

* The {mce} 2.4 and later installed on an {ocp-short} cluster. The {mce-short} is automatically installed when you install {product-title-short}. The {mce-short} can also be installed without {product-title-short} as an Operator from the {ocp-short} OperatorHub.

* The {mce-short} must have at least one managed {ocp-short} cluster. The `local-cluster` is automatically imported in {mce-short} 2.4 and later. See xref:../install_upgrade/adv_config_install.adoc#advanced-config-engine[Advanced configuration] for more information about the `local-cluster`. You can check the status of your hub cluster by running the following command:

+
----
oc get managedclusters local-cluster
----

* The AWS command line interface

* The xref:../hosted_control_planes/install_hcp_cli.adoc#hosted-install-cli[hosted control plane command line interface]

For additional resources about hosted control planes, see the following documentation:

* To disable the hosted control planes feature or, if you already disabled it and want to manually enable it, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/enable_or_disable_hosted.adoc#enable-or-disable-hosted-control-planes[Enabling or disabling the hosted control planes feature].

* To manage hosted clusters by running {aap} jobs, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/ansible_config_hosted_cluster.adoc#ansible-config-hosted-cluster[Configuring {aap-short} jobs to run on hosted clusters].

* To deploy the SR-IOV Operator, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/networking/hardware-networks#sriov-operator-hosted-control-planes_configuring-sriov-operator[Deploying the SR-IOV Operator for hosted control planes].
