[#configuring-dns-hosted-control-plane-ibmz]
= Configuring DNS for hosted control plane with IBM Z

The API server for the hosted cluster is exposed as a 'NodePort' service. A DNS entry must exist for the `api.<hosted_cluster_name>.<base-domain>` that points to the destination where the API server is reachable.

The DNS entry can be as simple as a record that points to one of the nodes in the managed cluster that is running the hosted control plane. 

The entry can also point to a load balancer deployed to redirect incoming traffic to the Ingress pods.

See the following example of DNS configuration:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /var/named/<example.krnl.es.zone>

See the following example output:

[source,text]
----
$ TTL 900
@ IN  SOA bastion.example.krnl.es.com. hostmaster.example.krnl.es.com. (
      2019062002

  IN NS bastion.example.krnl.es.com.

----
<1> The record refers to the IP address of the API load balancer that handles ingress and egress traffic for hosted control planes.

For IBM z/VM, add IP addresses that correspond to the IP address of the agent.
