[#configuring-dns-hosted-control-plane-ibmpower]
= Configuring DNS for hosted control planes on IBM Power

The API server for the hosted cluster is exposed. A DNS entry must exist for the `api.<hosted_cluster_name>.<base-domain>` entry that points to the destination where the API server is reachable.

The DNS entry can be as simple as a record that points to one of the nodes in the managed cluster that is running the hosted control plane.

The entry can also point to a load balancer that is deployed to redirect incoming traffic to the ingress pods.

See the following example of DNS configuration:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /var/named/<example.krnl.es.zone>  
----

See the following example output:

[source,text]

$ TTL 900

----
<1> The record refers to the IP address of the API load balancer that handles ingress and egress traffic for hosted control planes.

For IBM Power, add IP addresses that correspond to the IP address of the agent.
