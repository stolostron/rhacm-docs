[#configuring-hosting-service-cluster-configure-bm]
= Configuring the hosting cluster on bare metal

You can deploy hosted control planes by configuring a cluster to function as a hosting cluster. The hosting cluster is the {ocp-short} cluster where the control planes are hosted. The hosting cluster is also known as the _management_ cluster. 

*Note:* The management cluster is not the same thing as the _managed_ cluster. A managed cluster is a cluster that the hub cluster manages.

The hosted control planes feature is enabled by default.

The {mce-short} 2.4 supports only the default `local-cluster`, which is a hub cluster that is managed, and the hub cluster as the hosting cluster. 

On {product-title-short} 2.9, you can use the managed hub cluster, also known as the `local-cluster`, as the hosting cluster.

*Important:* 

- Run the hub cluster and workers on the same platform for hosted control planes.

- Each hosted cluster must have a unique name in order for {mce-short} to manage it.

- A hosted cluster cannot be created in the namespace of a {mce-short} managed cluster.

- To provision hosted control planes on bare metal, you can use the Agent platform. The Agent platform uses the central infrastructure management service to add worker nodes to a hosted cluster. For an introduction to the central infrastructure management service, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/cim_enable.adoc#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

- Each bare metal host must be started with a Discovery Image that the central infrastructure management provides. You can start the hosts manually or through automation by using `Cluster-Baremetal-Operator`. After each host starts, it runs an Agent process to discover the host details and complete the installation. An `Agent` custom resource represents each host.

- When you create a hosted cluster with the Agent platform, HyperShift installs the Agent Cluster API provider in the hosted control plane namespace.

- When you scale up a node pool, a machine is created. The Cluster API provider finds an Agent that is approved, is passing validations, is not currently in use, and meets the requirements that are specified in the node pool specification. You can monitor the installation of an Agent by checking its status and conditions.

- When you scale down a node pool, Agents are unbound from the corresponding cluster. Before you can reuse the clusters, you must restart them by using the Discovery image to update the number of nodes.

- When you configure storage for hosted control planes, consider the recommended etcd practices. To ensure that you meet the latency requirements, dedicate a fast storage device to all hosted control plane etcd instances that run on each control-plane node. You can use LVM storage to configure a local storage class for hosted etcd pods. For more information, see _Recommended etcd practices_ and _Persistent storage using logical volume manager storage_ in the {ocp-short} documentation.

[#hosting-service-cluster-configure-prereq]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites to configure a hosting cluster: 

* You need the {mce} 2.2 and later installed on an {ocp-short} cluster. The {mce-short} is automatically installed when you install {product-title-short}. You can also install {mce-short} without {product-title-short} as an Operator from the {ocp-short} OperatorHub.

* The {mce-short} must have at least one managed {ocp-short} cluster. The `local-cluster` is automatically imported in {mce-short} 2.2 and later. See xref:../install_upgrade/adv_config_install.adoc#advanced-config-engine[Advanced configuration] for more information about the `local-cluster`. You can check the status of your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get managedclusters local-cluster
----

* You need to enable central infrastructure management. For more information, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/cim_enable.adoc#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

* You need to xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted_install_cli.adoc#hosted-install-cli[install the hosted control plane command line interface].

[#firewall-port-reqs-bare-metal]
== Bare metal firewall and port requirements

Ensure that you meet the firewall and port requirements so that ports can communicate between the management cluster, the control plane, and hosted clusters:

* The `kube-apiserver` service runs on port 6443 by default and requires ingress access for communication between the control plane components. 

** If you use the `NodePort` publishing strategy, ensure that the node port that is assigned to the `kube-apiserver` service is exposed.
** If you use MetalLB load balancing, allow ingress access to the IP range that is used for load balancer IP addresses.

* If you use the `NodePort` publishing strategy, use a firewall rule for the `ignition-server` and `Oauth-server` settings.

* The `konnectivity` agent, which establishes a reverse tunnel to allow bi-directional communication on the hosted cluster, requires egress access to the cluster API server address on port 6443. With that egress access, the agent can reach the `kube-apiserver` service.

** If the cluster API server address is an internal IP address, allow access from the workload subnets to the IP address on port 6443.
** If the address is an external IP address, allow egress on port 6443 to that external IP address from the nodes.

* If you change the default port of 6443, adjust the rules to reflect that change.
* Ensure that you open any ports that are required by the workloads that run in the clusters.
* Use firewall rules, security groups, or other access controls to restrict access to only required sources. Avoid exposing ports publicly unless necessary.
* For production deployments, use a load balancer to simplify access through a single IP address.

[#infrastructure-reqs-bare-metal]
== Bare metal infrastructure requirements

The Agent platform does not create any infrastructure, but it does have the following requirements for infrastructure:

* Agents: An _Agent_ represents a host that is booted with a discovery image and is ready to be provisioned as an {ocp-short} node.

* DNS: The API and ingress endpoints must be routable.
