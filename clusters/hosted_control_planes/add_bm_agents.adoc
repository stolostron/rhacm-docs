[#hosted-bare-metal-adding-agents]
= Adding agents to the InfraEnv resource

You can add agents by manually configuring the machine to start with the live ISO or by using Metal3.

[#hosted-bare-metal-adding-agents-manual]
== Manually adding agents

. Download the live ISO and use it to start a host (bare metal or VM). The URL for the live ISO can be found in the `InfraEnv` resource, in the `status.isoDownloadURL` field. At startup, the host communicates with the Assisted Service and registers as an agent in the same namespace as the `InfraEnv` resource.

. To list the agents and some of their properties, enter the following command:

+
----
oc -n ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} get agents
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
NAME                                   CLUSTER   APPROVED   ROLE          STAGE
86f7ac75-4fc4-4b36-8130-40fa12602218                        auto-assign
e57a637f-745b-496e-971d-1abbf03341ba                        auto-assign
----

. After each agent is created, you can optionally set its `installation_disk_id` and `hostname` in the specification and approve the agent by entering the following commands: 

+
----
oc -n ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} patch agent 86f7ac75-4fc4-4b36-8130-40fa12602218 -p '{"spec":{"installation_disk_id":"/dev/sda","approved":true,"hostname":"worker-0.example.krnl.es"}}' --type merge

oc -n ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} patch agent 23d0c614-2caa-43f5-b7d3-0b3564688baa -p '{"spec":{"installation_disk_id":"/dev/sda","approved":true,"hostname":"worker-1.example.krnl.es"}}' --type merge
----

. To verify that the agents are approved for use, enter the following command and check the output:

+
----
oc -n ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} get agents
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
NAME                                   CLUSTER   APPROVED   ROLE          STAGE
86f7ac75-4fc4-4b36-8130-40fa12602218             true       auto-assign
e57a637f-745b-496e-971d-1abbf03341ba             true       auto-assign

[#hosted-bare-metal-adding-agents-metal3]
== Adding agents by using Metal3

*Important:* Because the `BareMetalHost` objects are created outside the baremetal-operator namespace, you must configure the Operator to watch all namespaces.

. Enter the following command:

+
----
oc patch provisioning provisioning-configuration --type merge -p '{"spec":{"watchAllNamespaces": true }}'
----

+
The `metal3` pod is restarted in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace.

. Enter the following command, which continuously checks the status of the pod and returns the status when it is ready:

+
----
oc wait -n openshift-machine-api $(oc get pods -n openshift-machine-api -l baremetal.openshift.io/cluster-baremetal-operator=metal3-state -o name) --for condition=containersready --timeout 5m
----

. Create your `BareMetalHost` objects by entering the following commands. You need to configure a few variables that are required to start your bare-metal hosts.

+
[source,bash]
----
export BMC_USERNAME=$(echo -n "root" | base64 -w0) <1>
export BMC_PASSWORD=$(echo -n "calvin" | base64 -w0) <2>
export BMC_IP="192.168.124.228" <3>
export WORKER_NAME="ocp-worker-0" <4>
export BOOT_MAC_ADDRESS="aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" <5>
export UUID="1" <6>
export REDFISH_SCHEME="redfish-virtualmedia" <7>
export REDFISH="${REDFISH_SCHEME}://${BMC_IP}/redfish/v1/Systems/${UUID}" <8>
----

+
<1> The user name to connect to the BMC.
<2> The password to connect to the BMC.
<3> The IP address that Metal3 uses to connect to the BMC.
<4> The name of the `BareMetalHost` object. This value is also used as the hostname.
<5> The MAC address of the NIC that is connected to the machine network.
<6> The Redfish UUID. This value is usually `1`. If you are using sushy-tools, this value is a long UUID. If you are using iDrac, this value is `System.Embedded.1`. You might need to check with the vendor.
<7> The Redfish provider to use. If you are using hardware that uses a standard Redfish implementation, you can set this value to `redfish-virtualmedia`. If you use iDrac, this value is `idrac-virtualmedia`. If you use iLO5, this value is `ilo5-virtualmedia`. You might need to check with the vendor.
<8> The Redfish connection endpoint.

. Create the `BareMetalHost` object by following these steps:

.. Create the BMC Secret:

+
----
oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: ${BMC_PASSWORD}
  username: ${BMC_USERNAME}
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ${WORKER_NAME}-bmc-secret
  namespace: ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE}
type: Opaque
----

.. Create the `BareMetalHost` object:

+
*Note:* The `infraenvs.agent-install.openshift.io` label is used to specify which `InfraEnv` is used to start the `BareMetalHost`. The `bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/hostname` label is used to manually set a hostname.

+
If you want to manually specify the installation disk, you can use the `rootDeviceHints` in the `BareMetalHost` specification. If `rootDeviceHints` are not provided, the agent picks the installation disk that better suits the installation requirements. For more information about `rootDeviceHints`, see the _rootDeviceHints_ section of the `BareMetalHost` documentation.

+
----
oc apply -f -
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
metadata:
  name: ${WORKER_NAME}
  namespace: ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE}
  labels:
    infraenvs.agent-install.openshift.io: ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}
  annotations:
    inspect.metal3.io: disabled
    bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/hostname: ${WORKER_NAME}
spec:
  automatedCleaningMode: disabled
  bmc:
    disableCertificateVerification: True
    address: ${REDFISH}
    credentialsName: ${WORKER_NAME}-bmc-secret
  bootMACAddress: ${BOOT_MAC_ADDRESS}
  online: true
----

+
The agent is automatically approved. If it is not approved, confirm that the `bootMACAddress` is correct.

+
The `BareMetalHost` is provisioned:

+
----
oc -n ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} get bmh
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
NAME           STATE          CONSUMER   ONLINE   ERROR   AGE
ocp-worker-0   provisioning              true             2m50s
----

+
The `BareMetalHost` eventually reaches the `provisioned` state:

+
----
oc -n ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} get bmh
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
NAME           STATE          CONSUMER   ONLINE   ERROR   AGE
ocp-worker-0   provisioned               true             72s
----

+
_Provisioned_ means that the host was configured to start from the virtualCD correctly. It takes a few moments for the agent to be displayed:

+
----
oc -n ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} get agent
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
NAME                                   CLUSTER   APPROVED   ROLE          STAGE
4dac1ab2-7dd5-4894-a220-6a3473b67ee6             true       auto-assign  
----

+
The agent is automatically approved. 

.. Repeat this process for all other hosts:

+
----
oc -n ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} get agent
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
NAME                                   CLUSTER   APPROVED   ROLE          STAGE
4dac1ab2-7dd5-4894-a220-6a3473b67ee6             true       auto-assign   
d9198891-39f4-4930-a679-65fb142b108b             true       auto-assign 
da503cf1-a347-44f2-875c-4960ddb04091             true       auto-assign
