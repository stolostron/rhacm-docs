[#configure-hosted-disconnected]
= Configuring hosted control planes in a disconnected environment

In the context of hosted control planes, a disconnected environment is an {ocp-short} deployment that is not connected to the internet and that uses hosted control planes as a base.

**Technology Preview:** You can deploy hosted control planes in a disconnected environment on bare-metal platforms by using an IPv4 or IPv6 network. In addition, hosted control planes in a disconnected environment is available on a dual-stack network as a Technology Preview feature. If you use the {ocp-virt} platform, hosted control planes in a disconnected environment is available as a Technology Preview feature only.

[#mce_and_agent]
== Disconnected environment architecture

When you provision hosted control planes on bare metal, you use the Agent platform. The Agent platform and {mce-short} work together to enable disconnected deployments. The Agent platform uses the central infrastructure management service to add worker nodes to a hosted cluster. For an introduction to the central infrastructure management service, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/cim_enable.adoc#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

[#configure-hosted-disconnected-networks-prereqs]
== Prerequisites 

To configure hosted control planes in a disconnected environment, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- CPU: The number of CPUs provided determines how many hosted clusters can run concurrently. In general, use 16 CPUs for each node for 3 nodes. For minimal development, you can use 12 CPUs for each node for 3 nodes.
- Memory: The amount of RAM affects how many hosted clusters can be hosted. Use 48 GB of RAM for each node. For minimal development, 18 GB of RAM might be sufficient.
- Storage: Use SSD storage for {mce-short}. 
* Management cluster: 250 GB.
* Registry: The storage needed depends on the number of releases, operators, and images that are hosted. An acceptable number might be 500 GB, preferably separated from the disk that hosts the hosted cluster.
* Web server: The storage needed depends on the number of ISOs and images that are hosted. An acceptable number might be 500 GB.
- Production: For a production environment, separate the management cluster, the registry, and the web server on different disks. This example illustrates a possible configuration for production:
* Registry: 2 TB
* Management cluster: 500 GB
* Web server: 2 TB
