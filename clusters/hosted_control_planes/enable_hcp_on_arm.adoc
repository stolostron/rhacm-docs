= Enabling hosted control planes on an ARM64 {ocp-short} cluster (Technology Preview)

You can enable an ARM64-hosted control plane to operate with an {ocp-short} ARM64 data plane in a management cluster environment. This feature is available for hosted control planes on AWS only.

[#prerequisites-hosted-arm]
== Prerequisites

You must have an {ocp-short} cluster that was installed on a 64-bit ARM infrastructure. For more information, see link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/arm[Create an OpenShift Cluster: AWS (ARM)].

[#hosted-cluster-arm64]
== Running a hosted cluster on an ARM64 {ocp-short} cluster

To run a hosted cluster on an ARM64 {ocp-short} cluster, complete the following steps:

. Create a hosted cluster that overrides the default release image with a multi-architecture release image. 

+
For example, through the hosted control plane command line interface, `hcp`, enter the following commands, and replace the cluster name, node pool replicas, base domain, pull secret, AWS credentials, and region with your information:

+
----
hcp create cluster aws \ 
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--node-pool-replicas=$NODEPOOL_REPLICAS \
--base-domain $BASE_DOMAIN \
--pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
--aws-creds $AWS_CREDS \
--region $REGION \
--release-image quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:{ocp-latest}.0-rc.0-multi
----

+
This example adds a default `NodePool` object through the `--node-pool-replicas` flag.

. Add a 64-bit x_86 `NodePool` object to the hosted cluster.

+
For example, through the hosted control plane command line interface, `hcp`, enter the following commands, being careful to replace the cluster name, node pool name, and node pool replicas with your information:

+
----
hcp create nodepool aws \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name $NODEPOOL_NAME \
--node-count=$NODEPOOL_REPLICAS
----

[#hosted-cluster-arm-node-pools]
== Creating ARM NodePool objects on AWS hosted clusters

You can schedule application workloads (`NodePool` objects) on 64-bit ARM and AMD64 from the same hosted control plane. To do so, you define the `arch` field in the `NodePool` specification to set the required processor architecture for the `NodePool` object. The valid values for the `arch` field are as follows:

* `arm64`
* `amd64`

If you do not specify a value for the `arch` field, the `amd64` value is used by default.

To create an ARM `NodePool` object on a hosted cluster on AWS, complete the following steps:

. Ensure that you have a multi-architecture image for the `HostedCluster` custom resource to use. You can access multi-architecture nightly images at link:https://multi.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org/[https://multi.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org/].

+
A multi-architecture nightly image resembles the following example:

+
----
% oc image info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release-nightly@sha256:9b992c71f77501678c091e3dc77c7be066816562efe3d352be18128b8e8fce94 -a ~/pull-secrets.json

error: the image is a manifest list and contains multiple images - use --filter-by-os to select from:

  OS            DIGEST

----

. Render the `NodePool` object by entering the following command on the hosted control plane command line interface, `hcp`:

+
----
hcp create nodepool aws --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME --name $ARM64_NODEPOOL_NAME --node-count=$NODEPOOL_REPLICAS --render > arm_nodepool_spec.yml
----

+
The command creates a YAML file that specifies the CPU architecture for the `NodePool` object, as shown in the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: hypershift-arm-us-east-1a

  replicas: 3
status:
  replicas: 0
----

. Modify the `arch` and `instanceType` values in the YAML file by entering the following command. In the command, the ARM instance type is `m6g.large`, but any ARM instance type works:

+
----
sed 's/arch: amd64/arch: arm64/g; s/instanceType: m5.large/instanceType: m6g.large/g' arm_nodepool_spec.yml > temp.yml && mv temp.yml arm_nodepool_spec.yml
----

. Apply the rendered YAML file to the hosted cluster by entering the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f arm_nodepool_spec.yml
