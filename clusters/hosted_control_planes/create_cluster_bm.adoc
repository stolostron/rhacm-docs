= Creating a hosted cluster on bare metal

You can create a hosted cluster on bare metal or import one. For instructions to import a hosted cluster, see _Importing a hosted cluster_.

. Create the hosted control plane namespace by entering the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc create ns <hosted_cluster_namespace>-<hosted_cluster_name>
----

+
Replace `<hosted_cluster_namespace>` with your hosted cluster namespace name, for example, `clusters`. Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with your hosted cluster name.

. Verify that you have a default storage class configured for your cluster. Otherwise, you might see pending PVCs. Run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
hcp create cluster agent \
    --name=<hosted_cluster_name> \ <1>
    --pull-secret=<path_to_pull_secret> \ <2>
    --agent-namespace=<hosted_control_plane_namespace> \ <3>
    --base-domain=<basedomain> \ <4>
    --api-server-address=api.<hosted_cluster_name>.<basedomain> \
    --etcd-storage-class=<etcd_storage_class> \ <5>
    --ssh-key  <path_to_ssh_public_key> \ <6>
    --namespace <hosted_cluster_namespace> \ <7>
    --control-plane-availability-policy SingleReplica \
    --release-image=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:<ocp_release_image> <8>
----

+
<1> Specify the name of your hosted cluster, for instance, `example`.
<2> Specify the path to your pull secret, for example, `/user/name/pullsecret`.
<3> Specify your hosted control plane namespace, for example, `clusters-example`. Ensure that agents are available in this namespace by using the `oc get agent -n <hosted_control_plane_namespace>` command.
<4> Specify your base domain, for example, `krnl.es`.
<5> Specify the etcd storage class name, for example, `lvm-storageclass`.
<6> Specify the path to your SSH public key. The default file path is `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
<7> Specify your hosted cluster namespace.
<8> Specify the supported {ocp-short} version that you want to use, for example, `4.14.0-x86_64`. If you are using a disconnected environment, replace `<ocp_release_image>` with the digest image. To extract the {ocp-short} release image digest, see _Extracting the {ocp-short} release image digest_.

+
. After a few moments, verify that your hosted control plane pods are up and running by entering the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc -n <hosted_control_plane_namespace> get pods
----

+
See the following example output:

+

[#hosted-create-bare-metal-console]
== Creating a hosted cluster on bare metal by using the console

. Open the {ocp-short} web console and log in by entering your administrator credentials. For instructions to open the console, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/web_console/web-console[Accessing the web console] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

. In the console header, ensure that **All Clusters** is selected.

. Click **Infrastructure > Clusters**.

. Click **Create cluster > Host inventory > Hosted control plane**.

+
The **Create cluster** page is displayed.

. On the **Create cluster** page, follow the prompts to enter details about the cluster, node pools, networking, and automation.

+
*Note:* As you enter details about the cluster, you might find the following tips useful:

** If you want to use predefined values to automatically populate fields in the console, you can create a host inventory credential. For more information, see _Creating a credential for an on-premises environment_.

** On the *Cluster details* page, the pull secret is your {ocp-short} pull secret that you use to access {ocp-short} resources. If you selected a host inventory credential, the pull secret is automatically populated.

** On the *Node pools* page, the namespace contains the hosts for the node pool. If you created a host inventory by using the console, the console creates a dedicated namespace.

** On the *Networking* page, you select an API server publishing strategy. The API server for the hosted cluster can be exposed either by using an existing load balancer or as a service of the `NodePort` type. A DNS entry must exist for the `api.${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASEDOMAIN}` setting that points to the destination where the API server can be reached. This entry can be a record that points to one of the nodes in the management cluster or a record that points to a load balancer that redirects incoming traffic to the Ingress pods.

. Review your entries and click **Create**.

+
The **Hosted cluster** view is displayed.

. Monitor the deployment of the hosted cluster in the **Hosted cluster** view.

. If you do not see information about the hosted cluster, ensure that **All Clusters** is selected, then click the cluster name.

. Wait until the control plane components are ready. This process can take a few minutes.

. To view the node pool status, scroll to the **NodePool** section. The process to install the nodes takes about 10 minutes. You can also click **Nodes** to confirm whether the nodes joined the hosted cluster.

[#creating-a-hosted-cluster-bm-icsp]
== Creating a hosted cluster on bare metal by using a mirror registry

You can use a mirror registry to create a hosted cluster on bare metal by specifying the `--image-content-sources` flag in the `hcp create cluster` command. Complete the following steps:

. Create a YAML file to define Image Content Source Policies (ICSP). See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
- mirrors:
  - brew.registry.redhat.io
  source: registry.redhat.io
- mirrors:
  - brew.registry.redhat.io
  source: registry.stage.redhat.io
- mirrors:
  - brew.registry.redhat.io
  source: registry-proxy.engineering.redhat.com
----

. Save the file as `icsp.yaml`. This file contains your mirror registries.

. To create a hosted cluster by using your mirror registries, run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
hcp create cluster agent \
    --name=<hosted_cluster_name> \ <1>
    --pull-secret=<path_to_pull_secret> \ <2>
    --agent-namespace=<hosted_control_plane_namespace> \ <3>
    --base-domain=<basedomain> \ <4>
    --api-server-address=api.<hosted_cluster_name>.<basedomain> \
    --image-content-sources icsp.yaml  \ <5>
    --ssh-key  <path_to_ssh_key> \ <6>
    --namespace <hosted_cluster_namespace> \ <7>
    --release-image=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:<ocp_release_image> <8>
----

+
<1> Specify the name of your hosted cluster, for instance, `example`.
<2> Specify the path to your pull secret, for example, `/user/name/pullsecret`.
<3> Specify your hosted control plane namespace, for example, `clusters-example`. Ensure that agents are available in this namespace by using the `oc get agent -n <hosted-control-plane-namespace>` command.
<4> Specify your base domain, for example, `krnl.es`.
<5> Specify the `icsp.yaml` file that defines ICSP and your mirror registries.
<6> Specify the path to your SSH public key. The default file path is `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
<7> Specify your hosted cluster namespace.
<8> Specify the supported {ocp-short} version that you want to use, for example, `4.14.0-x86_64`. If you are using a disconnected environment, replace `<ocp_release_image>` with the digest image. To extract the {ocp-short} release image digest, see _Extracting the {ocp-short} release image digest_.
