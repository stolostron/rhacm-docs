[#creating-a-hosted-cluster-bm]
= Creating a hosted cluster on bare metal

You can create a hosted cluster or import one. For instructions to import a hosted cluster, see _Importing a hosted cluster_.

. Verify that you have a default storage class configured for your cluster. Otherwise, you might end up with pending PVCs. Enter the following commands, replacing any example variables with your information:

+
----
export CLUSTERS_NAMESPACE="clusters"
export HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME="example"
export HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE="${CLUSTERS_NAMESPACE}-${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}" <1>
export BASEDOMAIN="krnl.es"
export PULL_SECRET_FILE=$PWD/pull-secret
export MACHINE_CIDR=192.168.122.0/24
export ETCD_STORAGE="lvm-storageclass"
export OCP_RELEASE=4.14.0-multi       
export SSH_KEY=${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
oc create ns ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE}

hcp create cluster agent \
    --name=${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --pull-secret=${PULL_SECRET_FILE} \
    --agent-namespace=${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} \
    --base-domain=${BASEDOMAIN} \
    --api-server-address=api.${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASEDOMAIN} \
    --etcd-storage-class=${ETCD_STORAGE} \
    --ssh-key  ${SSH_KEY} \
    --namespace ${CLUSTERS_NAMESPACE} \
    --control-plane-availability-policy SingleReplica \
    --release-image=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:${OCP_RELEASE} \
    --api-server-address=api.${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASEDOMAIN}

<1> Typically, the namespace is created by the HyperShift Operator, but agent cluster creation generates a cluster API provider role that needs the namespace to already exist.

. After a few moments, verify that your hosted control plane pods are up and running by entering the following command:

+
----
oc -n ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} get pods
----

+
See the following example output:

[#hosted-create-bare-metal-console]
== Creating a hosted cluster on bare metal by using the console

. Open the {ocp-short} web console and log in by entering your administrator credentials. For instructions to open the console, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/web_console/web-console[Accessing the web console] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

. In the console header, ensure that **All Clusters** is selected.

. Click **Infrastructure -> Clusters**.

. Click **Create cluster -> Host inventory -> Hosted control plane**.

+
The **Create cluster** page is displayed.

. On the **Create cluster** page, follow the prompts to enter details about the cluster, node pools, networking, and automation.

+
*Note:* As you enter details about the cluster, you might find the following tips useful:

** If you want to use predefined values to automatically populate fields in the console, you can create a host inventory credential. For more information, see _Creating a credential for an on-premises environment_.

** On the *Cluster details* page, the pull secret is your {ocp-short} pull secret that you use to access {ocp-short} resources. If you selected a host inventory credential, the pull secret is automatically populated.

** On the *Node pools* page, the namespace contains the hosts for the node pool. If you created a host inventory by using the console, the console creates a dedicated namespace.

** On the *Networking* page, you select an API server publishing strategy. The API server for the hosted cluster can be exposed either by using an existing load balancer or as a service of the `NodePort` type. A DNS entry must exist for the `api.${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASEDOMAIN}` setting that points to the destination where the API server can be reached. This entry can be a record that points to one of the nodes in the management cluster or a record that points to a load balancer that redirects incoming traffic to the Ingress pods.

. Review your entries and click **Create**.

+
The **Hosted cluster** view is displayed.

. Monitor the deployment of the hosted cluster in the **Hosted cluster** view. If you do not see information about the hosted cluster, ensure that **All Clusters** is selected, and click the cluster name.

. Wait until the control plane components are ready. This process can take a few minutes.

. To view the node pool status, scroll to the **NodePool** section. The process to install the nodes takes about 10 minutes. You can also click **Nodes** to confirm whether the nodes joined the hosted cluster.
