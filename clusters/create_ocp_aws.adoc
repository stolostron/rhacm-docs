[#creating-a-cluster-on-amazon-web-services]
= Creating a cluster on Amazon Web Services

You can use the {product-title} console to create a {ocp} cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

When you create a cluster, the creation process uses the {ocp-short} installer with the Hive resource. If you have questions about cluster creation after completing this procedure, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/installing/installing-on-aws[Installing on AWS] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information about the process.

[#aws_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a cluster on AWS:

* A deployed {product-title} hub cluster
* Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services
* AWS credential.
See link:../credentials/credential_aws.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-amazon-web-services[Creating a credential for Amazon Web Services] for more information.
* A configured domain in AWS.
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/installing/installing-on-aws#installing-aws-account[Configuring an AWS account] for instructions on how to configure a domain.
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) login credentials, which include user name, password, access key ID, and secret access key.
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html[Understanding and Getting Your Security Credentials].
* A {ocp-short} image pull secret.
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets].

*Note:* If you change your cloud provider access key, you must manually update the provisioned cluster access key. For more information, see the known issue, link:../release_notes/known_issues.adoc#automatic-secret-updates-for-provisioned-clusters-is-not-supported[Automatic secret updates for provisioned clusters is not supported].

[#aws-creating-your-cluster-with-the-console]
== Creating your cluster with the console

To create clusters from the {product-title} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*, and click *Create cluster* on the _Clusters_ page. Complete the steps in the console.
+
*Note:* This procedure is for creating a cluster.
If you have an existing cluster that you want to import, see xref:../clusters/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster] for those steps.

. Select your infrastructure provider credential from the available credentials on the list. If you do not have one configured, or if you want to configure a new one, select *Add credential*. See link:../credentials/credential_aws.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-amazon-web-services[Creating a credential for Amazon Web Services] for more information about creating a credential.

. Add the name and details for your cluster. The name is used in the hostname of the cluster.
+
*Tip:* You can view the `yaml` content updates as you enter the information in the console by setting the _YAML_ switch to *ON*.

.. Specify a _Cluster set_, if you want to add it to an existing cluster set. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges when you are creating the cluster, you must select a cluster set on which you have `clusterset-admin` permissions to create the cluster. If you do not select a cluster set, the cluster creation fails. Contact your cluster administrator to provide you with `clusterset-admin` permissions to a cluster set if you do not have cluster set options to select.
+
Every managed cluster must be associated with a managed cluster set. If you do not assign the managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

.. Specify the _Base DNS domain_ information that you configured for your AWS account. If there is already a base domain associated with the selected credential, that value is populated in that field. You can change the value by overwriting it. This name is used in the hostname of the cluster.
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/installing/installing-on-aws#installing-aws-account[Configuring an AWS account] for more information.

.. Specify a _Release image_ that you want to use for the cluster. This identifies the version of the {ocp-short} image that is used to create the cluster. If the version that you want to use is available, you can select the image from the list of images. If the image that you want to use is not a standard image, you can enter the url to the image that you want to use. See xref:../clusters/release_images.adoc#release-images[Release images] for more information about release images.

.. Add the _Additional Labels_ that you want to associate with your cluster. These labels help to identify the cluster and limit search results.

. Enter details about the Node pools, including the control plane pool and the worker pools. The control plane nodes share the management of the cluster activity. The optional information includes the following fields:
+
.. Specify one or more _Zones_ where you want to run your control plane pools. You can select multiple zones within the region for a more distributed group of control plane nodes. A closer zone might provide faster performance, but a more distant zone might be more distributed.

.. Specify an _Instance type_ for your control plane node. You can change the type and size of your instance after it is created. 

.. Enter your _Root storage_ allocation. 

. Enter details about your worker pools. You can create zero or more worker nodes in a worker pool to run the container workloads for the cluster. They can be in a single worker pool, or distributed across multiple worker pools. If zero worker nodes are specified, the control plane nodes also function as worker nodes. The optional information includes the following fields:
+
.. Specify one or more _Zones_ where you want to run your worker pools. You can select multiple zones within the region for a more distributed group of nodes. A closer zone might provide faster performance, but a more distant zone might be more distributed.

.. Specify an _Instance type_ for your worker pools. You can change the type and size of your instance after it is created.

.. Enter a _Node count_ for your worker pool. This setting is required when you define a worker pool.

.. Enter your _Root storage_ allocation. This setting is required when you define a worker pool.
+
You can define additional worker pools by clicking *Add worker pool*.

. Enter the networking details for your cluster. This information is required. Multiple networks are required for using IPv6.
+
You can add an additional network by clicking *Add network*. 

. Add your proxy information, if you want to enable a proxy. Proxy information that is provided in the credential is automatically added.

. Add an optional _Ansible Automation Template_ to run either before or after your cluster installs or upgrades.
+
You can click *Add automation template* to create a template.
  
. Review your information and optionally customize it.
+
.. Click the *YAML* slider to *On* to view the `install-config.yaml` file content in the panel. 
.. Edit the YAML file with your custom settings. 

. Select *Create* to create the cluster. 
+
*Note:* You do not have to run the `kubectl` command that is provided with the cluster details to import the cluster. When you create the cluster, it is automatically configured under the management of {product-title-short}. 

Your cluster is created. Continue with link:../clusters/access_cluster.adoc#accessing-your-cluster[Accessing your cluster] for instructions for accessing your cluster.
