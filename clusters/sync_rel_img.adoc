= Synchronizing available release images

The release images are updated frequently, so you might want to synchronize the list of release images to ensure that you can select the latest available versions.
The release images are available in the https://github.com/stolostron/acm-hive-openshift-releases/tree/release-2.4[acm-hive-openshift-releases] GitHub repository for release 2.4.

There are three levels of stability of the release images:

.Stability levels of release images
|===
|Category |Description
|stable
|Fully tested images that are confirmed to install and build clusters correctly.

|fast
|Partially tested, but likely less stable than a stable version.

|candidate
|Not tested, but the most current image. Might have some bugs. 
|===

Complete the following steps to refresh the list:

. If the installer-managed `acm-hive-openshift-releases` subscription is enabled, disable the subscription by setting the value of `disableUpdateClusterImageSets` to `true`. You can remove the subscription by entering a command that is similar to the following command:
+
----
oc delete -f subscription/subscription-stable
----

. Clone the https://github.com/stolostron/acm-hive-openshift-releases/tree/release-2.4[acm-hive-openshift-releases] GitHub repository for release 2.4.

. Connect to the stable release images and synchronize your {product-title} hub cluster by entering the following command: 
+
----
make subscribe-stable
----
+
*Note:* You can only run this `make` command when you are using the Linux or MacOS operating system. 
+
After about one minute, the latest list of `stable` release images is available. 

* To synchronize and display the fast release images, enter the following command:
+
----
make subscribe-fast
----
+
*Note:* You can only run this `make` command when you are using the Linux or MacOS operating system. 
+
About one minute after running the command, the list of available `stable` and `fast` release images updates with the currently available images.
+   
* To synchronize and display the `candidate` release images, enter the following command:
+
----
make subscribe-candidate
----
+
*Note:* You can only run this `make` command when you are using the Linux or MacOS operating system. 
+
About one minute after running the command, the list of available `stable`, `fast`, and `candidate` release images updates with the currently available images.

. View the list of currently available release images in the {product-title-short} console when you are creating a cluster.

. You can unsubscribe from any of these channels to stop viewing the updates by entering a command in the following format: 

+
----
oc delete -f subscription/subscription-stable
