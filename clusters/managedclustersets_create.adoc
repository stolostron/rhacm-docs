= Creating a ManagedClusterSet

You can group managed clusters together in a managed cluster set to limit the user access on managed clusters.  

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

A `ManagedClusterSet` is a cluster-scoped resource, so you must have cluster administration permissions for the cluster where you are creating the `ManagedClusterSet`. A managed cluster cannot be included in more than one `ManagedClusterSet`. You can create a managed cluster set from either the {product-title} console or from the command-line interface.

[#creating-a-managedclusterset-console]

. Select *Create cluster set*.

. Enter the name of the cluster set that you want to create.

. Select *Create* to create the cluster set resource.

== Creating a ManagedClusterSet by using the command line

Add the following definition of the managed cluster set to your `yaml` file to create a managed cluster set by using the command line:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: ManagedClusterSet
metadata:
  name: <clusterset1>
----

Replace `clusterset1` with the name of your managed cluster set.
