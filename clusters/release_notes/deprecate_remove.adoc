= Deprecations and removals Cluster lifecycle

Learn when parts of the product are deprecated or removed from {mce-short}. Consider the alternative actions in the _Recommended action_ and details, which display in the tables for the current release and for two prior releases. Tables are removed if no entries are added for that section this release.

*Deprecated:* {mce-short} 2.2 and earlier versions are no longer supported. The documentation might remain available, but without any Errata or other updates.

*Best practice:* Upgrade to the most recent version.

  - All `V1` APIs are generally available and supported for 12 months or three releases, whichever is greater. V1 APIs are not removed, but can be deprecated outside of that time limit.
  - All `beta` APIs are generally available for nine months or three releases, whichever is greater. Beta APIs are not removed outside of that time limit.
  - All `alpha` APIs are not required to be supported, but might be listed as deprecated or removed if it benefits users.
