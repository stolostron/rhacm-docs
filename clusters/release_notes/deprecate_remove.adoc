[#api-deprecations-info-cluster]
== API deprecations and removals

{mce-short} follows the Kubernetes deprecation guidelines for APIs. See the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/[Kubernetes Deprecation Policy] for more details about that policy. {mce-short} APIs are only deprecated or removed outside of the following timelines:
  
  - All `V1` APIs are generally available and supported for 12 months or three releases, whichever is greater. V1 APIs are not removed, but can be deprecated outside of that time limit.
  - All `beta` APIs are generally available for nine months or three releases, whichever is greater. Beta APIs are not removed outside of that time limit.
  - All `alpha` APIs are not required to be supported, but might be listed as deprecated or removed if it benefits users.
