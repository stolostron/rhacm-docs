[#cluster-lifecycle]
== Cluster lifecycle

Learn about what's new relating to Cluster lifecycle with {mce-short}.

You can now configure the proxy settings for cluster proxy add-ons to allow a managed cluster to communicate with the hub cluster through a HTTP and HTTPS proxy server. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/cluster_proxy_addon.adoc#cluster-proxy-addon-settings[Configuring proxy settings for cluster proxy add-ons] to learn more.

[#credential]
== Credentials

* You can now configure the _Cluster OS image_ field to create a credential by using the {mce-short} console for disconnected installations on VMware vSphere. For more information, see xref:../credentials/credential_vm.adoc#vsphere_cred[Managing a credential by using the console].

[#hosted-control-plane]
== Hosted control planes

* **Technology Preview:** You can provision a hosted control plane cluster by using the non bare metal agent machines. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/non_bm_intro.adoc#configuring-hosting-service-cluster-configure-agent-non-bm[Configuring hosted control plane clusters using non bare metal agent machines].

* You can now create a hosted cluster with the KubeVirt platform by using the console. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/create_cluster_kubevirt.adoc#hosted-create-kubevirt-console[Creating a hosted cluster by using the console].

* You can now configure additional networks, request a guaranteed CPU access for Virtual Machines (VMs), and manage scheduling of KubeVirt VMs for node pools. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/managing_nodepools_kubevirt.adoc#managing-nodepools-hosted-cluster-kubevirt[Configuring additional networks, guaranteed CPUs, and VM scheduling for node pools].
