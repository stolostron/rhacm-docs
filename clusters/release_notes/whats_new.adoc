[#whats-new]
= What's new in Cluster lifecycle with the {mce-short}

Learn about new features for creating, importing, managing, and destroying Kubernetes clusters across various infrastructure cloud providers, private clouds, and on-premises data centers.
 
*Important:* Cluster lifecycle now supports all providers that are certified through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Kubernetes Conformance Program. Choose a vendor that is recognized by CNFC for your hybrid cloud multicluster management. 

See the following information about using CNFC providers:

* Learn how CNFC providers are certified at link:https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/[Certified Kubernetes Conformance]. 

* For Red Hat support information about CNFC third-party providers, see link:https://access.redhat.com/third-party-software-support[Red Hat support with third party components], or link:https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/[Contact Red Hat support].

* If you bring your own CNFC conformance certified cluster, you need to change the {ocp-short} CLI `oc` command to the Kubernetes CLI command, `kubectl`.

== Cluster lifecycle

Learn about new features and enhancements for Cluster lifecycle with {mce-short}.

- You can now push custom labels to the automation job pod created by the `ClusterCurator`. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/ansible_config_cluster.adoc#push-cl-cr-job-pod[Pushing custom labels from the _ClusterCurator_ resource to the automation job pod] to learn more.

- You can now automatically apply configurations in the global `KlusterletConfig` on every managed cluster, without binding a managed cluster to a `KlusterletConfig` with an annotation. To learn more, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/adv_config_cluster.adoc#config-gloabl-klusterletconfig[Configuring the global _KlusterletConfig_].

- Placements do not select managed clusters that you are deleting. To learn more about placements, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/placement_overview.adoc#placement-overview[Placement overview].

- The `discovery-operator` now automatically imports ROSA clusters into {product-title-short} hub cluster. See, link:../discovery/discovery_import.adoc#discovery_import[Import Discovered clusters].
