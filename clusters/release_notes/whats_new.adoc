[#install-whats-new-mce]
== Install

If you installed {ocp-short} or {product-title-short}, you automatically receive {mce-short}. If any new features exist for {mce-short} install only, you can view them in this section.

You can now use the {olm} `operatorcondition` resource to enforce the {mce-short} upgrade procedure, which prevent errors from attempts to skip releases. 

[#cluster-lifecycle]
== Cluster lifecycle
 
Learn about what's new relating to Cluster lifecycle with {mce-short}.

- You can now create an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) secret from *Credentials* in the console. See xref:../clusters/credentials/credential_aws.adoc#aws_s3_create[Creating an S3 secret].

- You can now add hosts to an infrastructure environment with iPXE.

- To save time, you can now run only the failed Ansible posthooks that are part of cluster automation templates. See xref:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/ansible_config_cluster.adoc#ansible-rerun-job-cluster[Running a failed Ansible job again] for more information.

- For more control of where your klusterlet runs, you can now configure your managed cluster klusterlet to run on specific nodes by specifying the values for `nodeSelector` and `tolerations`. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/import_gui.adoc#import-configuring-nodeselector-tolerations[Optional: Configuring the klusterlet to run on specific nodes] for more information. 

- For convenience, you can add your pull secret and SSH public key to your host inventory credential, then automatically populate those fields by selecting the cluster when creating a cluster in an on-premises environment. See xref:../clusters/credential_on_prem.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-an-on-premises-environment[Creating a credential for an on-premises environment] for more information.  

- Use the `ClusterCurator` resource to specify an Ansible inventory to use for all jobs. This is also available to {mce-short} users in the console as well. See xref:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/ansible_config_cluster.adoc#specify-ansible-inventory[Specifying an Ansible inventory to use for all jobs] for more information. 

- You can use the central infrastructure management feature to create a bare metal {ocp-short} cluster on Nutanix. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/create_cluster_on_prem.adoc#on-prem-creating-your-cluster-with-the-cli[Creating your cluster with the command line].

- If you are using {ocp-short} version 4.13 or later, you can now delete worker nodes by using GitOps.

[#hosted-control-plane]
== Hosted control planes

- Technology Preview: You can provision a hosted control plane cluster on the Amazon Web Services or bare metal platforms. See xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted_intro.adoc#hosted-control-planes-intro[Hosted control planes (Technology Preview)] for additional information.
