[#whats-new]
= What's new in Cluster lifecycle with the {mce-short}

Learn about new features for creating, importing, managing, and destroying Kubernetes clusters across various infrastructure cloud providers, private clouds, and on-premises data centers.

*Important:* Cluster lifecycle now supports all providers that are certified through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Kubernetes Conformance Program. Choose a vendor that is recognized by CNFC for your hybrid cloud multicluster management.

See the following information about using CNFC providers:

* Learn how CNFC providers are certified at link:https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/[Certified Kubernetes Conformance].

* For Red Hat support information about CNFC third-party providers, see link:https://access.redhat.com/third-party-software-support[Red Hat support with third party components], or link:https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/[Contact Red Hat support].

* If you bring your own CNFC conformance certified cluster, you need to change the {ocp-short} CLI `oc` command to the Kubernetes CLI command, `kubectl`.

[#cluster-lifecycle]
== Cluster lifecycle

Learn about new features and enhancements for Cluster lifecycle with {mce-short}.

- You can now push custom labels to the automation job pod created by the `ClusterCurator`. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/ansible_config_cluster.adoc#push-cl-cr-job-pod[Pushing custom labels from the _ClusterCurator_ resource to the automation job pod] to learn more.

- You can now automatically apply configurations in the global `KlusterletConfig` on every managed cluster, without binding a managed cluster to a `KlusterletConfig` with an annotation. To learn more, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/adv_config_cluster.adoc#config-gloabl-klusterletconfig[Configuring the global _KlusterletConfig_].

- PlacementDecision now works more efficiently by excluding managed clusters that you are deleting. To learn more about placements, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/placement_overview.adoc#placement-overview[Placement overview].

- You can now enable a discovered cluster to automatically import supported clusters into your hub cluster with the `discovery-operator`. Import clusters for faster cluster management. See link:../discovery/enable_discovery.adoc#enable-discovered[Enabling a discovered cluster for management].

- You can use the `ClusterCurator` resource to perform easier, automatic upgrades from Extended Update Support (EUS) to EUS. The `spec.upgrade.intermediateUpdate` is added to the `ClusterCurator` resource with the intermediate release value before the final upgrade to the `desiredUpdate`. Find the procedure and the example at xref:../cluster_lifecycle/ansible_config_cluster.adoc#eus-upgrades[Using the _ClusterCurator_ for Extended Update Support (EUS) upgrades].

- You can now use the {assist-install} to install a cluster in FIPS mode. See link:../../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/cim_enable.adoc#fips-install-cim[Installing a FIPS-enabled cluster by using the {assist-install}].

== {product-title-short} integration

* You can now automate the import of {rosa} clusters by using {product-title-short} policy enforcement with {mce-short} for faster cluster management. Learn more at link:../../clusters/acm_integration/acm_integrate_import_rosa.adoc#import-discover-rosa[Automating import for discovered {rosa} clusters].

* You can now discover and automate the import of hosted clusters, as well. Configure  {product-title-short} to import {mce-short} clusters and then use policy enforcement for automation. Learn more at xref:../../clusters/acm_integration/acm_discover_hosted.adoc#discover-hosted-acm[Automating import for discovered hosted clusters].
