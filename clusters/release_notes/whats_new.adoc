[#cluster-lifecycle]
== Cluster lifecycle

Learn about what's new relating to Cluster lifecycle with {mce-short}.

- You can now configure the proxy settings for cluster proxy add-ons to allow a managed cluster to communicate with the hub cluster through a HTTP and HTTPS proxy server. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/cluster_proxy_addon.adoc#cluster-proxy-addon-settings[Configuring proxy settings for cluster proxy add-ons] to learn more.

- The `ManagedServiceAccount` add-on is now enabled by default. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/addon_managed_service.adoc#managed-serviceaccount-addon[Enabling ManagedServiceAccount add-ons] to learn more about enabling the add-on if you are upgrading from {mce-short} version 2.4.

- *Technology Preview:* You can now customize the server URL and hub cluster API CA bundle so that you can import a managed cluster on your {mce-short} hub cluster, even if you have intermediate components. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/adv_config_cluster.adoc#custom-server-url-ca[Customizing the server URL and hub cluster API CA bundle (Technology Preview)] to learn more.

- You can now pass HTTP/HTTPS headers and query parameters in each request to fetch an OS image. To learn more, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/cim_enable.adoc#enable-cim-disconnected[Enabling central infrastructure management in disconnected environments].

[#credential]
== Credentials

* You can now configure the _Cluster OS image_ field to create a credential by using the {mce-short} console for disconnected installations on VMware vSphere. For more information, see xref:../credentials/credential_vm.adoc#vsphere_cred[Managing a credential by using the console].

[#hosted-control-plane]
== Hosted control planes

* **Technology Preview:** You can provision a hosted control plane cluster by using the non bare metal agent machines. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/non_bm_intro.adoc#configuring-hosting-service-cluster-configure-agent-non-bm[Configuring hosted control plane clusters using non bare metal agent machines].

* You can now create a hosted cluster with the KubeVirt platform by using the console. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/create_cluster_kubevirt.adoc#hosted-create-kubevirt-console[Creating a hosted cluster by using the console].

* You can now configure additional networks, request a guaranteed CPU access for Virtual Machines (VMs), and manage scheduling of KubeVirt VMs for node pools. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/managing_nodepools_kubevirt.adoc#managing-nodepools-hosted-cluster-kubevirt[Configuring additional networks, guaranteed CPUs, and VM scheduling for node pools].

[#acm-integration-wn]
== {product-title-short} integration

If you enable Observability after you install {product-title-short}, you can use Grafana dashboards to view your hosted control planes cluster capacity estimate, and existing hosted control planes resource utilizations. See more at xref:../install_upgrade/acm_integration.adoc#acm-integration[{product-title-short} integration].
