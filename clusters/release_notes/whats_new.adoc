Learn about what's new relating to Cluster lifecycle with {mce-short}.

- You can now use the `cluster-proxy-addon` to connect to any service on a managed cluster by using a proxy. Reach directly into the managed cluster from the hub to interact with some services. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/cluster_proxy_addon.adoc#cluster-proxy-addon[Using cluster proxy add-ons] for information.

- You can now create clusters on Amazon Web Services GovCloud. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/create_aws_govcloud.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-amazon-web-services-govcloud[Creating a cluster on Amazon Web Services GovCloud] for more information.

There are new versions of the following APIs:
- `Clusterset`: v1beta2
- `ClustersetBinding`: v1beta2
See xref:../api/api_intro.adoc#apis[APIs] for more information.

- You can use two control plane types: hosted and standalone. _Standalone_ is the console wizard feature and _Hosted_ provides to specific steps and guidance so that you can create the cluster from your CLI.

- You can now update the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource to specify whether a hub cluster is managed by itself. See xref:../install_upgrade/adv_config_install.adoc#local-cluster[Local cluster enablement] for more information.

- You can modify the settings in the `ConfigMap` and `AgentServiceConfig` files to specify unauthenticated registries when creating an infrastructure environment in a disconnected environment. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/create_infra_env.adoc#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service] for more information.

- Scaling with MachinePool is now generally available so you can easily configure autoscaling to scale your resources. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/scale_machinepool.adoc#scaling-machinepool[Scaling with MachinePool] for more information.

[#hosted-control-plane]
== Hosted control planes

- Technology Preview: You can provision a hosted control plane cluster on the Amazon Web Services or bare metal platforms. See xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted_intro.adoc#hosted-control-planes-intro[Hosted control planes (Technology Preview)] for additional information.
