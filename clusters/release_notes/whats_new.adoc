Learn about what's new relating to Cluster lifecycle with {mce-short}.

- You can now create an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) secret from *Credentials* in the console. See xref:../clusters/credentials/credential_aws.adoc#aws_s3_create[Creating an S3 secret].

- You can now add hosts to an infrastructure environment with iPXE. See xref:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/scale_hosts_infra_env.adoc#scale-hosts-infrastructure-env[Scaling hosts to an infrastructure environment] for more information.

- To save time, you can now run only the failed Ansible posthooks that are part of cluster automation templates. See xref:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/ansible_config_cluster.adoc#ansible-rerun-job-cluster[Running a failed Ansible job again] for more information.

- To add flexibility, you can now configure your managed cluster klusterlet to run on specific nodes by specifying the values for `nodeSelector` and `tolerations`. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/import_gui.adoc#import-configuring-nodeselector-tolerations[Optional: Configuring the klusterlet to run on specific nodes] for more information. 

- For convenience, you can add your pull secret and SSH public key to your host inventory credential, then automatically populate those fields by selecting the cluster when creating a cluster in an on-premises environment. See xref:../clusters/credential_on_prem.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-an-on-premises-environment[Creating a credential for an on-premises environment] for more information.  

- ClusterCurator now supports specifying an Ansible inventory to use for all jobs, and this is available to {mce-short} users in the console as well.

[#hosted-control-plane]
== Hosted control planes

- Technology Preview: You can provision a hosted control plane cluster on the Amazon Web Services or bare metal platforms. See xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted_intro.adoc#hosted-control-planes-intro[Hosted control planes (Technology Preview)] for additional information.
