== Errata 2.4.6

* Delivers updates to one or more of the product container images.

== Errata 2.4.5

* Fixes the CA bundle comparison logic of the import controller that resolves an issue with the controller refreshing the bootstrap hub cluster `kubeconfig` when a custom API server certificate is used with a blank line between certificates. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10999[ACM-10999])

* Fixes agent components that were using `open-cluster-management-image-pull-credentials` as the default image pull secret without checking whether the secret exists. Without a secret, the pods reported a warning message. This update delivers an empty secret when `open-cluster-management-image-pull-credentials` is not set. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-9982[ACM-9982])
