[#id-k8s-io-not-updated-311]
=== Value of the cluster claim _id.k8s.io_ on {ocp-short} version 3.11 is lost after upgrading to {product-title-short} 2.7
//2.7:ACM3000

After upgrading to {product-title-short} 2.7, the value of cluster claim `id.k8s.io` is missing for a managed cluster that is running on {ocp-short} 3.11. The value is stored in the `clusterclaims.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` file.

To cause the value to repopulate, manually delete the `id.k8s.io` setting by entering the following command:

----
oc delete clusterclaims.cluster.open-cluster-management.io  id.k8s.io
----

The cluster claim is re-created automatically.

[#console-hosted-pending-import]
=== Console displays hosted cluster as Pending import 
//2.7:25594

If the annotation and `ManagedCluster` name do not match, the console displays the cluster as `Pending import`. The cluster cannot be used by the {mce}. The same issue happens when there is no annotation and the `ManagedCluster` name does not match the `Infra-ID` value of the `HostedCluster` resource.

[#add-node-pool-duplicate-version]
=== Console might list the same version multiple times when adding a node pool to a hosted cluster 
//2.7:ACM-2664

When you use the console to add a new node pool to an existing hosted cluster, the same version of {ocp-short} might appear more than once in the list of options. You can select any available instance.
