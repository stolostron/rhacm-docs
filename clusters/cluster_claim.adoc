= Claiming clusters from cluster pools

`ClusterClaim` resources are used to check out clusters from cluster pools. After a cluster is checked out from a cluster pool, the checked out cluster is brought to a ready state. The cluster pool automatically creates a new hibernated cluster in the cluster pool to replace the claimed one.

*Note:* When a cluster that was claimed from the cluster pool is no longer needed and is destroyed, the resources are deleted. The cluster does not return to the cluster pool.

*Required access*: Administrator

[#claim_prerequisite]
== Prerequisite

You must have the following available before claiming a cluster from a cluster pool:

A cluster pool with available clusters to claim. See xref:../clusters/cluster_pool_manage.adoc#creating-a-clusterpool[Creating a cluster pool] for information about how to create a cluster pool. If there are no available clusters to claim, the *Claim cluster* button is not displayed.

[#claim_cluster]
== Claim the cluster from the cluster pool

To checkout a cluster from the cluster pool, resume the cluster and claim it as one of your managed clusters. Complete the following steps to claim a cluster:
        
. From the navigation menu, click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the _Cluster pools_ tab.

. Find the name of the cluster pool you want to claim a cluster from and select *Claim cluster*.

. Enter a cluster claim name to help identify the cluster.

. Select *Claim*.

The claimed cluster comes out of hibernation and appears in the *Managed Cluster* tab with a status of `Resuming`.  After the cluster reaches a status of  `Ready`, the cluster is available for use.
