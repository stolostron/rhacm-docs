[#creating-a-cluster-on-microsoft-azure]
= Creating a cluster on Microsoft Azure

You can use the {product-title} console to deploy a {ocp} cluster on Microsoft Azure or on Microsoft Azure Government.

When you create a cluster, the creation process uses the {ocp-short} installer with the Hive resource. If you have questions about cluster creation after completing this procedure, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/installing/installing-on-azure[Installing on Azure] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information about the process.

[#azure_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

See the following prerequisites before creating a cluster on Azure:

* You must have a deployed {product-title} hub cluster.
* You need Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Azure or Azure Government
* You need an Azure credential. See link:../credentials/credential_azure.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-microsoft-azure[Creating a credential for Microsoft Azure] for more information.
* You need a configured domain in Azure or Azure Government. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-custom-domain-name-portal[Configuring a custom domain name for an Azure cloud service] for instructions on how to configure a domain.
* You need Azure login credentials, which include user name and password. See the https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/features/azure-portal[Microsoft Azure Portal].
* You need Azure service principals, which include `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `tenantId`. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest#password-based-authentication[azure.microsoft.com].
* You need an {ocp-short} image pull secret. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets].

*Note:* If you change your cloud provider access key, you must manually update the provisioned cluster access key. For more information, see the known issue, link:../release_notes/known_issues.adoc#automatic-secret-updates-for-provisioned-clusters-is-not-supported[Automatic secret updates for provisioned clusters is not supported]. 

//we are not supposed to link to known issues in the main doc, that is a slippery slope and that also was an architect meeting from many releases ago where everyone (whole team) agreed. This seems a bit rogue, I will raise the issue again. I recommend either making this part of the doc or removing it. 

[#azure_creating-your-cluster-with-the-console]
== Creating your cluster with the console

To create a cluster from the {product-title} console, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. On the _Clusters_ page, click *Create cluster* and complete the steps in the console. 

*Note:* This procedure is for creating a cluster. If you have an existing cluster that you want to import, see xref:../clusters/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster] for those steps.

If you need to create a credential, see link:../credentials/credential_azure.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-microsoft-azure[Creating a credential for Microsoft Azure] for more information.

The name of the cluster is used in the hostname of the cluster.

*Important:* When you create a cluster, the {product-title-short} controller creates a namespace for the cluster and its resources. Ensure that you include only resources for that cluster instance in that namespace. Destroying the cluster deletes the namespace and all of the resources in it.

*Tip:* Select *YAML: On* to view content updates as you enter the information in the console. 

If you want to add your cluster to an existing cluster set, you must have the correct permissions on the cluster set to add it. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges when you are creating the cluster, you must select a cluster set on which you have `clusterset-admin` permissions. If you do not have the correct permissions on the specified cluster set, the cluster creation fails. Contact your cluster administrator to provide you with `clusterset-admin` permissions to a cluster set if you do not have any cluster set options to select.

Every managed cluster must be associated with a managed cluster set. If you do not assign the managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

If there is already a base DNS domain that is associated with the selected credential that you configured for your Azure account, that value is populated in that field. You can change the value by overwriting it. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-custom-domain-name-portal[Configuring a custom domain name for an Azure cloud service] for more information. This name is used in the hostname of the cluster.

The release image identifies the version of the {ocp-short} image that is used to create the cluster. If the version that you want to use is available, you can select the image from the list of images. If the image that you want to use is not a standard image, you can enter the URL to the image that you want to use. See xref:../clusters/release_images.adoc#release-images[Release images] for more information about release images. 

The Node pools include the control plane pool and the worker pools. The control plane nodes share the management of the cluster activity. The information includes the following fields:

 * *Optional* Region: Specify a region where you want to run your node pools. You can select multiple zones within the region for a more distributed group of control plane nodes. A closer zone might provide faster performance, but a more distant zone might be more distributed.

 * *Optional* Architecture: If the architecture type of the managed cluster is not the same as the architecture of your hub cluster, enter a value for the instruction set architecture of the machines in the pool. Valid values are _amd64_, _ppc64le_, _s390x_, and _aarch64_.

 * *Optional* Instance type and Root storage allocation (required) for your control plane pool. You can change the type and size of your instance after it is created.

You can create one or more worker nodes in a worker pool to run the container workloads for the cluster. They can be in a single worker pool, or distributed across multiple worker pools. If zero worker nodes are specified, the control plane nodes also function as worker nodes. The information includes the following fields: 

 * Zones: Specifies here you want to run your worker pools. You can select multiple zones within the region for a more distributed group of nodes. A closer zone might provide faster performance, but a more distant zone might be more distributed.

 * Instance type: You can change the type and size of your instance after it is created.

You can add an additional network by clicking *Add network*. You must have more than one network if you are using IPv6 addresses.

Proxy information that is provided in the credential is automatically added to the proxy fields. You can use the information as it is, overwrite it, or add the information if you want to enable a proxy. The following list contains the required information for creating a proxy:  

 * HTTP proxy URL: The URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

 * HTTPS proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.

 * No proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add an asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

 * Additional trust bundle: The contents of the certificate file that is required to access the mirror registry.

When you review your information and optionally customize it before creating the cluster, you can click the *YAML* switch *On* to view the `install-config.yaml` file content in the panel. You can edit the YAML file with your custom settings, if you have any updates. 

**Note:** You do not have to run the `kubectl` command that is provided with the cluster details to import the cluster. When you create the cluster, it is automatically configured under the management of {product-title-short}. 

Continue with xref:../clusters/access_cluster.adoc#accessing-your-cluster[Accessing your cluster] for instructions for accessing your cluster.
