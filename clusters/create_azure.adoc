[#creating-a-cluster-on-microsoft-azure]
= Creating a cluster on Microsoft Azure

You can use the {product-title} console to deploy a {ocp} cluster on Microsoft Azure or on Microsoft Azure Government.

When you create a cluster, the creation process uses the {ocp-short} installer with the Hive resource. If you have questions about cluster creation after completing this procedure, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/installing/installing-on-azure[Installing on Azure] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information about the process.

[#azure_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a cluster on Azure:

* A deployed {product-title} hub cluster.
* Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Azure or Azure Government.
* Azure credential.
+
See link:../credentials/credential_azure.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-microsoft-azure[Creating a credential for Microsoft Azure] for more information.
* A configured domain in Azure or Azure Government.
+
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-custom-domain-name-portal[Configuring a custom domain name for an Azure cloud service] for instructions on how to configure a domain.
* Azure login credentials, which include user name and password.
See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/features/azure-portal[Microsoft Azure Portal].
* Azure service principals, which include `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `tenantId`.
+
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest#password-based-authentication[azure.microsoft.com].
* An {ocp-short} image pull secret.
+
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets].

*Note:* If you change your cloud provider access key, you must manually update the provisioned cluster access key. For more information, see the known issue, link:../release_notes/known_issues.adoc#automatic-secret-updates-for-provisioned-clusters-is-not-supported[Automatic secret updates for provisioned clusters is not supported].

[#azure_creating-your-cluster-with-the-console]
== Creating your cluster with the console

To create a cluster from the {product-title} console complete the following steps:

. Navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. On the _Clusters_ page, click *Create cluster* and complete the steps in the console.
+
*Note:* This procedure is for creating a cluster.
If you have an existing cluster that you want to import, see xref:../clusters/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster] for those steps.

. Select your infrastructure provider credential from the available credentials on the list. See link:../credentials/credential_azure.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-microsoft-azure[Creating a credential for Microsoft Azure] for more information about creating a credential, if necessary.

. Add the name and details for your cluster. The name of the cluster is used in the hostname of the cluster.
+
*Tip:* You can view the `yaml` content updates as you enter the information in the console by setting the _YAML_ switch to *ON*. 
+
.. Specify a _Cluster set_, if you want to add it to an existing cluster set on which you have `cluster-admin` privileges. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges when you are creating the cluster, you must select a cluster set on which you have `clusterset-admin` permissions. If you do not have the correct permissions on the specified cluster set, the cluster creation fails. Contact your cluster administrator to provide you with `clusterset-admin` permissions to a cluster set if you do not have cluster set options to select.
+
Every managed cluster must be associated with a managed cluster set. If you do not assign the managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

.. Specify the _Base DNS domain_ information that you configured for your Azure account. If there is already a base domain that is associated with the selected credential, that value is populated in that field. You can change the value by overwriting it.
+
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-custom-domain-name-portal[Configuring a custom domain name for an Azure cloud service] for more information. This name is used in the hostname of the cluster.

.. Specify a _Release image_ to use for the cluster. The release image identifies the version of the {ocp-short} image that is used to create the cluster. If the version that you want to use is available, you can select the image from the list of images. If the image that you want to use is not a standard image, you can enter the URL to the image that you want to use. See xref:../clusters/release_images.adoc#release-images[Release images] for more information about release images.

. Enter details about the Node pool, including the control plane pool and the worker pools. The control plane nodes share the management of the cluster activity. The optional information includes the following fields:

.. Specify a _Region_ where you want to run your node pools. You can select multiple zones within the region for a more distributed group of control plane nodes. A closer zone might provide faster performance, but a more distant zone might be more distributed.

.. Specify an _Instance type_ (optional) and _Root storage_ allocation (required) for your control plane pool. You can change the type and size of your instance after it is created.

. Enter details about your worker pools. You can create one or more worker nodes in a worker pool to run the container workloads for the cluster. They can be in a single worker pool, or distributed across multiple worker pools. If zero worker nodes are specified, the control plane nodes also function as worker nodes. 
+
.. Specify one or more _Zones_ where you want to run your worker pools. You can select multiple zones within the region for a more distributed group of nodes. A closer zone might provide faster performance, but a more distant zone might be more distributed.

.. Specify an _Instance type_ for your worker pools. You can change the type and size of your instance after it is created.

. Enter the required networking details for your cluster.
+
You can add an additional network by clicking *Add network*. You must have more than one network if you are using IPv6 addresses.

. Add your proxy information, if you want to enable a proxy. 

. Add an optional _Ansible Automation Template_ to run either before or after your cluster installs or upgrades.
+
You can click *Add automation template* to create a template. 
 
. Review your information and optionally customize it before creating the cluster.
.. Click the *YAML* slider to *On* to view the `install-config.yaml` file content in the panel. 
.. Edit the YAML file with your custom settings. 

*Note:* You do not have to run the `kubectl` command that is provided with the cluster details to import the cluster. When you create the cluster, it is automatically configured under the management of {product-title-short}. 

Your cluster is created. Continue with link:../clusters/access_cluster.adoc#accessing-your-cluster[Accessing your cluster] for instructions for accessing your cluster.
