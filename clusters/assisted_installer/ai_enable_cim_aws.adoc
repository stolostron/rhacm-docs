= Enabling {cim} on Amazon Web Services

If you are running your hub cluster on Amazon Web Services and want to enable the {cim} service, complete the following steps after xref:cim_enable.adoc#enable-cim[Enabling the {cim} service]:

. Make sure you are logged in at the hub cluster and find the unique domain configured on the `assisted-image-service` by running the following command:
+
----
oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep assisted-image-service
----
//do we get routes with the integrated console? A bug came out for other topics, could not get a review on this in time, please check next time this is edited. --bcs 6/23
+
Your domain might resemble the following example: `assisted-image-service-multicluster-engine.apps.<yourdomain>.com`

. Make sure you are logged in at the hub cluster and create a new `IngressController` with a unique domain using the `NLB` `type` parameter. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: ingress-controller-with-nlb
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  domain: nlb-apps.<domain>.com
  routeSelector:
      matchLabels:
        router-type: nlb
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: LoadBalancerService
    loadBalancer:
      scope: External
      providerParameters:
        type: AWS
        aws:
          type: NLB
----

. Add `<yourdomain>` to the `domain` parameter in `IngressController` by replacing `<domain>` in `nlb-apps.<domain>.com` with `<yourdomain>`.

. Apply the new `IngressController` by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f ingresscontroller.yaml
----

. Make sure that the value of the `spec.domain` parameter of the new `IngressController` is not in conflict with an existing `IngressController` by completing the following steps:

.. List all `IngressControllers` by running the following command:
+
----
oc get ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator
----

.. Run the following command on each of the `IngressControllers`, except the `ingress-controller-with-nlb` that you just created:
+
----
oc edit ingresscontroller <name> -n openshift-ingress-operator
----
+
If the `spec.domain` report is missing, add a default domain that matches all of the routes that are exposed in the cluster except `nlb-apps.<domain>.com`.
+
If the `spec.domain` report is provided, make sure that the `nlb-apps.<domain>.com` route is excluded from the specified range.

. Run the following command to edit the `assisted-image-service` route to use the `nlb-apps` location:
+
----
oc edit route assisted-image-service -n <namespace>
----
+
The default namespace is where you installed the {mce-short}.

. Add the following lines to the `assisted-image-service` route:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  labels:
    router-type: nlb
  name: assisted-image-service
----

. In the `assisted-image-service` route, find the URL value of `spec.host`. The URL might resemble the following example: 
+
----
assisted-image-service-multicluster-engine.apps.<yourdomain>.com
----

. Replace `apps` in the URL with `nlb-apps` to match the domain configured in the new `IngressController`.

. To verify that the {cim} service is enabled on Amazon Web Services, run the following command to verify that the pods are healthy:
+
----
oc get pods -n multicluster-engine | grep assist
----

. Create a new host inventory and ensure that the download URL uses the new `nlb-apps` URL.
