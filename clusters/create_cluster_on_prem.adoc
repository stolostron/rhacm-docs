[#creating-a-cluster-on-premises]
= Creating a cluster in an on-premises environment

You can use the {product-title} console to create an on-premises {ocp} cluster. This process is recommended instead of the bare metal process that is deprecated.

[#on-prem-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

See the following prerequisites before creating a cluster in an on-premises environment:

* You must have a deployed {product-title-short} hub cluster on {ocp-short} version 4.9, or later.
* You need a configured infrastructure environment with configured hosts.
* You must have Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster (connected), or a connection to an internal or mirror registry that has a connection to the Internet (disconnected) to retrieve the required images for creating the cluster.
* You need a configured on-premises credential. See link:../credentials/credential_on_prem.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-an-on-premises-environment[Creating a credential for an on-premises environment] for more information.
* You need an {ocp-short} image pull secret. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets] for more information.

== Creating your cluster with the console

To create a cluster from the {product-title} console, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. On the _Clusters_ page, click *Create cluster* and complete the steps in the console.

The following options are available for your assisted installation: 

* *Use existing discovered hosts*: Select your hosts from a list of hosts that are in an existing infrastructure environment.

* *Discover new hosts*: Discover hosts that are not already in an existing infrastructure environment. Discover your own hosts, rather than using one that is already in an infrastructure environment.

If you need to create a credential, see link:../credentials/credential_on_prem.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-an-on-premises-environment[Creating a credential for an on-premises environment] for more information.

The name for your cluster is used in the hostname of the cluster.

*Tip:* Select *YAML: On* to view content updates as you enter the information in the console.

If you want to add your cluster to an existing cluster set, you must have the correct permissions on the cluster set to add it. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges when you are creating the cluster, you must select a cluster set on which you have `clusterset-admin` permissions. If you do not have the correct permissions on the specified cluster set, the cluster creation fails. Contact your cluster administrator to provide you with `clusterset-admin` permissions to a cluster set if you do not have any cluster set options to select.

Every managed cluster must be associated with a managed cluster set. If you do not assign the managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

If there is already a base DNS domain that is associated with the selected credential that you configured for your provider account, that value is populated in that field. You can change the value by overwriting it, but this setting cannot be changed after the cluster is created. The base domain of your provider is used to create routes to your {ocp} cluster components. It is configured in the DNS of your cluster provider as a Start of Authority (SOA) record. 

A single-node OpenShift (SNO) cluster contains a single node which hosts the control plane services and the user workloads. This configuration can be helpful when you want to minimize the resource footprint of the cluster. If you want your cluster to be a SNO cluster, select the SNO option. SNO clusters are only supported on {ocp-short} version 4.9, and later. If you did not select a release image of {ocp-short} version 4.9, or later, the option for selecting a SNO cluster is not available. 

*Tip:* After you review and save the cluster, your cluster is saved as a draft cluster. You can close the creation process and finish the process later by selecting the cluster name on the _Clusters_ page.

If you are using existing hosts, select whether you want to select the hosts yourself, or if you want them to be selected automatically. The number of hosts is based on the number of nodes that you selected. For example, a SNO cluster only requires one host, while a standard three-node cluster requires three hosts. 

The locations of the available hosts that meet the requirements for this cluster are displayed in the list of _Host locations_. For distribution of the hosts and a more high-availability configuration, select multiple locations.

If you are discovering new hosts with no existing infrastructure environment, complete the steps in xref:../clusters/add_hosts_infra_env.adoc#adding-hosts-to-an-infrastructure-environment[Adding hosts to an infrastructure environment] beginning with step 4 to define your hosts.   

After the hosts are bound, and the validations pass, complete the networking information for your cluster by adding the following IP addresses: 

* API VIP: Specifies the IP address to use for internal API communication.
+
*Note:* This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section. If not provided, the DNS must be pre-configured so that `api.` resolves correctly.

* Ingress VIP: Specifies the IP address to use for ingress traffic.
+
*Note:* This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section. If not provided, the DNS must be pre-configured so that `test.apps.` resolves correctly.

You can view the status of the installation on the _Clusters_ navigation page. 

Continue with xref:../clusters/access_cluster.adoc#accessing-your-cluster[Accessing your cluster] for instructions for accessing your cluster.
