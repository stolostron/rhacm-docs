[#creating-a-cluster-on-premises]
= Creating a cluster in an on-premises environment

You can use the {product-title} console to create an on-premises {ocp} cluster.

*Note:* The {product-title-short} on-premises deployment is a Technology Preview feature, but the resulting single node OpenShift (SNO) cluster is fully supported on {ocp-short} version 4.9 only for bare metal deployments.

[#on-prem-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You need the following prerequisites before creating a cluster in an on-premises environment:

* A deployed {product-title-short} hub cluster on {ocp-short} version 4.9, or later.
* A configured infrastructure environment with configured hosts.
* Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster (connected), or a connection to an internal or mirror registry that has a connection to the Internet (disconnected) to retrieve the required images for creating the cluster.
* A configured on-premises credential. See link:../credentials/credential_on_prem.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-an-on-premises-environment[Creating a credential for an on-premises environment] for more information.
* A {ocp-short} image pull secret; see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets].

== Creating your cluster with the console

To create clusters from the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. On the _Clusters_ page, click *Create cluster*.
. Select one of the following options for your assisted installation: 
+
* *Use existing discovered hosts*: Select your hosts from a list of hosts that are in an existing infrastructure environment.
* *Discover new hosts*: Discover hosts that are not already in an existing infrastructure environment. Discover your own hosts, rather than using one that is already in an infrastructure environment.

+
The remaining steps are based on your selection.

. Select your credential from the available credentials on the list.
If you do not have one configured, or want to configure a new one, select *Add credential*. See link:../credentials/credential_on_prem.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-an-on-premises-environment[Creating a credential for an on-premises environment] for more information about creating a credential.
. Add the details for your cluster:
.. Enter a name for your cluster.
+
*Tip:* You can view the `yaml` content updates as you enter the information in the console by setting the _YAML_ switch to *ON*.
.. Specify a _Cluster set_, if you want to add it to an existing cluster set. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges when you are creating the cluster, you must select a cluster set on which you have `clusterset-admin` permissions to create the cluster. If you do not select a cluster set, the cluster creation fails. Contact your cluster administrator to provide you with `clusterset-admin` permissions to a cluster set if you do not have cluster set options to select.
+
Every managed cluster must be associated with a managed cluster set. If you do not assign the managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.
.. Specify the _Base DNS domain_ information that you configured for your provider account. The base domain of your provider is used to create routes to your {ocp} cluster components. It is configured in your cluster provider's DNS as a Start of Authority (SOA) record. If there is already a base domain associated with the selected credential, that value is populated in that field. You can change the value by overwriting it, but this setting cannot be changed after the cluster is created.
.. If you want your cluster to be a SNO cluster, select the SNO option. A SNO cluster only creates one node, rather than the three nodes that are created by a standard cluster.  
.. Add the _Additional Labels_ that you want to associate with your cluster. These labels help to identify the cluster and limit search results.
. Configure any Automation templates that you want to run during creation or upgrade of the cluster. 
. Review and save your cluster. 
+
*Tip:* After you review and save the cluster at this point, your cluster is saved as a draft cluster. You can close the creation process and finish the process later by selecting the cluster name on the _Clusters_ page. 
. Select your hosts.
+
* If you are using existing hosts, select whether you want to select the hosts yourself, or if you want them to be selected automatically. The number of hosts is based on the number of nodes that you selected. For example, a SNO cluster only requires one host, while a standard three-node cluster requires three hosts. 
+
The locations of the available hosts that meet the requirements for this cluster are displayed in the list of _Host locations_. For distribution of the hosts and a more high-availability configuration, select multiple locations.
* If you are discovering new hosts with no existing infrastructure environment, complete the steps in xref:../clusters/add_hosts_infra_env.adoc##adding-hosts-to-an-infrastructure-environment[Adding hosts to an infrastructure environment] beginning with step 4 to define your hosts.   

. After the hosts are bound, and the validations pass, complete the networking information for your cluster by adding the following IP addresses: 
+
* _API VIP_: The IP address to use for internal API communication.
+
*Note:* This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section. If not provided, the DNS must be pre-configured so that `api.` resolves correctly.
* _Ingress VIP_: The IP address to use for ingress traffic.
+
*Note:* This value must match the name that you used to create the DNS records listed in the prerequisites section. If not provided, the DNS must be pre-configured so that `test.apps.` resolves correctly.

You can view the status of the installation on the _Clusters_ navigation page. 

Your cluster is created. Continue with link:../clusters/access_cluster.adoc#accessing-your-cluster[Accessing your cluster] for instructions for accessing your cluster.
