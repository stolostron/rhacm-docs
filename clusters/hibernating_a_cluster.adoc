[#hibernating-a-created-cluster]
= Hibernating a created cluster (Technology Preview)

You can hibernate a cluster that was created using {product-title} to conserve resources. A hibernating cluster requires significantly fewer resources than one that is running, so you can potentially lower your provider costs by moving clusters in and out of a hibernating state. This feature only applies to clusters that were created by {product-title-short} in the following environments:

* Amazon Web Services
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform

[#hibernate-cluster-console]
== Hibernate a cluster by using the console
// These UI steps can be cut down

To use the {product-title-short} console to hibernate a cluster that was created by {product-title-short}, complete the following steps:

. From the {product-title-short} navigation menu, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. Ensure that the _Manage clusters_ tab is selected.

. Select *Hibernate cluster* from the the _Options_ menu for the cluster. *Note:* If the _Hibernate cluster_ option is not available, you cannot hibernate the cluster. This can happen when the cluster is imported, and not created by {product-title-short}.

The status for the cluster on the _Clusters_ page is `Hibernating` when the process completes. 

*Tip:* You can hibernate multiple clusters by selecting the clusters that you want to hibernate on the _Clusters_ page, and selecting *Actions* > *Hibernate clusters*.

Your selected cluster is hibernating.

[#hibernate-cluster-cli]
== Hibernate a cluster by using the CLI

To use the CLI to hibernate a cluster that was created by {product-title-short}, complete the following steps:

. Enter the following command to edit the settings for the cluster that you want to hibernate: 
+
----
oc edit clusterdeployment <name-of-cluster> -n <namespace-of-cluster>
----
+
Replace `name-of-cluster` with the name of the cluster that you want to hibernate. 
+
Replace `namespace-of-cluster` with the namespace of the cluster that you want to hibernate. 

. Change the value for `spec.powerState` to `Hibernating`.

. Enter the following command to view the status of the cluster:
+
----
oc get clusterdeployment <name-of-cluster> -n <namespace-of-cluster> -o yaml
----
+
Replace `name-of-cluster` with the name of the cluster that you want to hibernate. 
+
Replace `namespace-of-cluster` with the namespace of the cluster that you want to hibernate.
+
When the process of hibernating the cluster is complete, the value of the type for the cluster is `type=Hibernating`.

Your selected cluster is hibernating.

[#resuming-normal-operation-of-a-hibernating-cluster-console]
== Resuming normal operation of a hibernating cluster by using the console

To resume normal operation of a hibernating cluster by using the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:

. From the {product-title-short} navigation menu, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. Ensure that the _Manage clusters_ tab is selected.

. Select *Resume cluster* from the the _Options_ menu for the cluster that you want to resume.

The status for the cluster on the _Clusters_ page is `Ready` when the process completes.

*Tip:* You can resume multiple clusters by selecting the clusters that you want to resume on the _Clusters_ page, and selecting *Actions* > *Resume clusters*.

Your selected cluster is resuming normal operation. 

[#resuming-normal-operation-of-a-hibernating-cluster-cli]

To resume normal operation of a hibernating cluster by using the CLI, complete the following steps:

. Enter the following command to edit the settings for the cluster:

Replace `name-of-cluster` with the name of the cluster that you want to hibernate. 
+
Replace `namespace-of-cluster` with the namespace of the cluster that you want to hibernate.

. Change the value for `spec.powerState` to `Running`.

. Enter the following command to view the status of the cluster:
+
----
oc get clusterdeployment <name-of-cluster> -n <namespace-of-cluster> -o yaml
----
+
Replace `name-of-cluster` with the name of the cluster that you want to hibernate. 
+
Replace `namespace-of-cluster` with the namespace of the cluster that you want to hibernate.
+
When the process of resuming the cluster is complete, the value of the type for the cluster is `type=Running`.

Your selected cluster is resuming normal operation.
