[#running-the-must-gather-command-to-troubleshoot-mce]
= Running the must-gather command to troubleshoot

To get started with troubleshooting, learn about the troubleshooting scenarios for users to run the `must-gather` command to debug the issues, then see the procedures to start using the command.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#scenarios-mce]
== Must-gather scenarios

* *Scenario one:* Use the _Documented troubleshooting_ section to see if a solution to your problem is documented. The guide is organized by the major functions of the product.

+
With this scenario, you check the guide to see if your solution is in the documentation.
+

* *Scenario two:* If your problem is not documented with steps to resolve, run the `must-gather` command and use the output to debug the issue.

* *Scenario three:* If you cannot debug the issue using your output from the `must-gather` command, then share your output with Red Hat Support.

[#procedure-mce]
== Must-gather procedure

See the following procedure to start using the `must-gather` command:

. Learn about the `must-gather` command and install the prerequisites that you need at link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/support/support-overview#support-overview-gather-data-cluster[Gathering data about your cluster] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

. Log in to your cluster. For the usual use-case, you should run the `must-gather` while you are logged into your _engine_ cluster. 

+
*Note:* If you want to check your managed clusters, find the `gather-managed.log` file that is located in the `cluster-scoped-resources` directory:
+

+
----
<your-directory>/cluster-scoped-resources/gather-managed.log>
----
+

Check for managed clusters that are not set `True` for the JOINED and AVAILABLE column. You can run the `must-gather` command on those clusters that are not connected with `True` status.

. Add the multicluster engine for Kubernetes image that is used for gathering data and the directory. Run the following command: 

----
oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/multicluster-engine/must-gather-rhel9:v2.6 --dest-dir=<directory>
----
  
. Go to your specified directory to see your output, which is organized in the following levels:

 - Two peer levels: `cluster-scoped-resources` and `namespace` resources.
 - Sub-level for each: API group for the custom resource definitions for both cluster-scope and namespace-scoped resources.
 - Next level for each: YAML file sorted by `kind`.

[#must-gather-disconnected-mce]
== Must-gather in a disconnected environment

Complete the following steps to run the `must-gather` command in a disconnected environment: 

. In a disconnected environment, mirror the Red Hat operator catalog images into their mirror registry. For more information, see xref:../install_upgrade/install_disconnected.adoc#install-on-disconnected-networks[Install on disconnected networks].

. Run the following command to extract logs, which reference the image from their mirror registry. Replace `sha256` with the current image:

----
REGISTRY=registry.example.com:5000
IMAGE=$REGISTRY/multicluster-engine/must-gather-rhel9@sha256:ff9f37eb400dc1f7d07a9b6f2da9064992934b69847d17f59e385783c071b9d8>

oc adm must-gather --image=$IMAGE --dest-dir=./data
----
