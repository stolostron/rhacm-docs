= Symptom: HostedCluster resource stuck in partial state

A hosted control plane is not coming fully online because a `HostedCluster` resource is pending.

[#identifying-hostedcluster-resource-stuck]
== Identifying the problem: Check prerequisites, resource conditions, and node and operator status

* Ensure that you meet all of the prerequisites for a hosted cluster on {ocp-virt}

* View the conditions on the `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` resources for validation errors that prevent progress.

* By using the `kubeconfig` file of the hosted cluster, inspect the status of the hosted cluster: 

** View the output of the `oc get clusteroperators` command to see which cluster operators are pending. 

** View the output of the `oc get nodes` command to ensure that worker nodes are ready.
