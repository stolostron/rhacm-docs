= Troubleshooting all managed clusters become `Unknown` on a ROSA with hosted control planes cluster

On a Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with hosted control planes cluster, the state of all managed clusters might switch to `Unknown`.

[#symptom-state-unknown-rosa-hcp]
== Symptom: All managed clusters become `Unknown` on a ROSA with hosted control planes cluster

The state of all managed cluster on a ROSA hosted cluster suddenly becomes `Unknown`. When you check the `klusterlet-agent` pod log in the `open-cluster-management-agent` namespace on your managed cluster, you see the following error message: 

[source,bash]

== Resolving the problem: All managed clusters become `Unknown` on a ROSA with hosted control planes cluster

To resolve the problem, add the `ISRG Root X1` certificate to the klusterlet CA bundle by completing the following steps:

. Download and encode the root CA certificate by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
curl -s https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem | base64 | tr -d "\n"
----

. Create a `KlusterletConfig` resource and add your encoded CA certificate to the `spec` parameter section. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: KlusterletConfig
metadata:
  name: global
spec:
  hubKubeAPIServerCABundle: "<your_ca_certificate>"
----

. Apply the resource by running the following command on the hub cluster:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f <filename>
----
+
The state of some managed clusters might recover.

. For managed clusters that remain `Unknown`, export and decode the `import.yaml` file from the hub cluster by running the following command on the hub cluster. Replace values where needed:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get secret <cluster_name>-import -n <cluster_name> -o jsonpath={.data.import/.yaml} | base64 --decode > <cluster_name>-import.yaml
----

. Apply the file by running the following command on the managed cluster. Replace values where needed:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f <cluster_name>-import.yaml
----
