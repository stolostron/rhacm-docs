= Troubleshooting managed clusters _Unknown_ on {rosa} with hosted control planes cluster

The status of all managed clusters on a {rosa} hosted clusters suddenly becomes `Unknown`.

== Symptom: All managed clusters are in _Unknown_ status on {rosa} with hosted control planes cluster

When you check the `klusterlet-agent` pod log in the `open-cluster-management-agent` namespace on your managed cluster, you see an error that resembles the following:

== Resolving the problem: All managed clusters are in _Unknown_ status on {rosa} with hosted control planes cluster

. Create a `KlusterletConfig` resource with name `global` if it does not exist.

. Set the `spec.hubKubeAPIServerConfig.serverVerificationStrategy` to `UseSystemTruststore`. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: KlusterletConfig
metadata:
  name: global
spec:
  hubKubeAPIServerConfig:
    serverVerificationStrategy: UseSystemTruststore
----

. Apply the resource by running the following command on the hub cluster. Replace `<filename>` with the name of your file:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f <filename>
----

+
The state of some managed clusters might recover. Continue with the process for managed clusters that remain in the `Unknown` status.

. Export and decode the `import.yaml `file from the hub cluster by running the following command on the hub cluster. Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your cluster.

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get secret <cluster_name>-import -n <cluster_name> -o jsonpath={.data.import\.yaml} | base64 --decode > <cluster_name>-import.yaml
----

. Apply the file by running the following command on the managed cluster. 

+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f <cluster_name>-import.yaml
----
