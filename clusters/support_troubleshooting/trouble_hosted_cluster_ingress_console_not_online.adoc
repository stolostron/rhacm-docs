= Symptom: Ingress and console cluster operators are not coming online

A hosted control plane is not coming fully online because the Ingress and console cluster operators are not online.

== Identifying the problem: Check wildcard DNS routes and load balancer

* If the cluster uses the default Ingress behavior, enter the following command to ensure that wildcard DNS routes are enabled on the {ocp-short} cluster that the virtual machines (VMs) are hosted on:

+
----
oc patch ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator default --type=json -p '[{ "op": "add", "path": "/spec/routeAdmission", "value": {wildcardPolicy: "WildcardsAllowed"}}]'
----

* If you use a custom base domain for the hosted control plane, complete the following steps:

** Ensure that the load balancer is targeting the VM pods correctly.

** Ensure that the wildcard DNS entry is targeting the load balancer IP.
