== Resolving the problem: Discovery failure of bare metal hosts on Dell hardware

The iDRAC is configured not to accept certificates from unknown certificate authorities. 

To bypass the problem, disable the certificate verification on the baseboard management controller of the host iDRAC by completing the following steps: 

. In the iDRAC console, navigate to *Configuration* > *Virtual media* > *Remote file share*.

. Change the value of *Expired or invalid certificate action* to `Yes`.
