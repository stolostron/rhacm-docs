= Troubleshooting: Adding day-two nodes to an existing cluster fails with pending user action

Adding a node, or scaling out, to your existing cluster that is created by the {mce} with Zero Touch Provisioning or Host inventory create methods fails during installation. The installation process works correctly during the Discovery phase, but fails on the installation phase. 

The configuration of the network is failing. From the hub cluster in the integrated console, you see a `Pending` user action. In the description, you can see it failing on the rebooting step.

The error message about failing is not very accurate, since the agent that is running in the installing host cannot report information.
 
[#symptom-network-config-fail]
== Symptom: Installation for day two workers fails

After the Discover phase, the host reboots to continue the installation, but it cannot configure the network. Check for the following symptoms and messages:

* From the hub cluster in the integrated console, check for `Pending` user action on the adding node, with the `Rebooting` indicator:
+
----
This host is pending user action. Host timed out when pulling ignition. Check the host console... Rebooting
----

* From the {ocp} configuration managed cluster, check the `MachineConfigs` of the existing cluster. Check if any of the `MachineConfigs` create any file on the following directories: 

 ** `/sysroot/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/` 
 ** `/sysroot/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` 

* From the terminal of the installing host, check the failing host for the following messages. You can use `journalctl` to see the log messages:

----
info: networking config is defined in the real root

info: will not attempt to propagate initramfs networking
----

If you get the last message in the log, the networking configuration is not propagated because it already found an existing network configuration on the folders previously listed in the _Symptom_.

[#resolving-network-config-fail]
== Resolving the problem: Recreate the node merging network configuration

Perform the following task to use a proper network configuration during the installation:

. Delete the node from your hub cluster.
. Repeat your previous process to install the node in the same way.
. Then, create the `BareMetalHost` object of the node with the following annotation: 
----
"bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/installer-args": "[\"--append-karg\", \"coreos.force_persist_ip\"]"
----

The node starts the installation. After the Discovery phase, the node merges the network configuration between the changes on the existing cluster and the initial configuration.
