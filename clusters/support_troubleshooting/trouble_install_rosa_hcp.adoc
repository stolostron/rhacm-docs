= Troubleshooting installation status stuck at `Installing` on a {rosa} hosted cluster

When installing {mce} on a {rosa} hosted cluster, {mce-short} becomes stuck at the `Installing` step and the `local-cluster` remains in the `Unknown` state.

== Symptom: Installation status stuck at `Installing` on a {rosa} hosted cluster

10 mintues after installing {mce-short}, the `local-cluster` remains in the `Unknown` state. When you check the `klusterlet-agent` pod log in the `open-cluster-management-agent` namespace on your managed cluster, you see an error that resembles the following: 

[source,bash]

== Resolving the problem: Installation status stuck at `Installing` on a {rosa} hosted cluster

To resolve the problem, add the `ISRG Root X1` certificate to the klusterlet CA bundle by completing the following steps:

. Download and encode the root CA certificate by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
curl -s https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem | base64 | tr -d "\n"
----

. Create a `KlusterletConfig` resource add your encoded CA certificate to the `spec`. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: KlusterletConfig
metadata:
  name: isrg-root-x1-ca
spec:
  hubKubeAPIServerCABundle: "<your_ca_certificate>"
----

. Apply the resource by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f <filename>
----

. Annotate your managed cluster by running the following command. Replace values where needed:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc annotate --overwrite <cluster_name> local-cluster agent.open-cluster-management.io/klusterlet-config='isrg-root-x1-ca'
----

. If the `local-cluster` state does not recover in 1 minute, export the `import.yaml` file by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get secret local-cluster-import -n local-cluster -o jsonpath={.data.import .yaml} 
----

. Decode the file by running the following command

+
[source,bash]
----
base64 --decode > import.yaml
----

. Apply the file by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f import.yaml
----

. For new clusters only, add the following annotation to the `ManagedCluster` resource:

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  agent.open-cluster-management.io/klusterlet-config: isrg-root-x1-ca
----
