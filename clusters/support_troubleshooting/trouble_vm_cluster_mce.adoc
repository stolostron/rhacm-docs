= Troubleshooting cluster creation on VMware vSphere

If you experience a problem when creating a {ocp} cluster on VMware vSphere, see the following troubleshooting information to see if one of them addresses your problem.

*Note:* Sometimes when the cluster creation process fails on VMware vSphere, the link is not enabled for you to view the logs. If this happens, you can identify the problem by viewing the log of the `hive-controllers` pod. The `hive-controllers` log is in the `hive` namespace.  

== Managed cluster creation fails with certificate IP SAN error

[#symptom-vsphere-fails-cert-ip-san-mce]
=== Symptom: Managed cluster creation fails with certificate IP SAN error

After creating a new {ocp} cluster on VMware vSphere, the cluster fails with an error message that indicates a certificate IP SAN error.  

[#identifying-the-problem-vsphere-fails-cert-ip-san-mce]
=== Identifying the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with certificate IP SAN error

The deployment of the managed cluster fails and returns the following errors in the deployment log:

----
time="2020-08-07T15:27:55Z" level=error msg="Error: error setting up new vSphere SOAP client: Post https://147.1.1.1/sdk: x509: cannot validate certificate for xx.xx.xx.xx because it doesn't contain any IP SANs"

=== Resolving the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with certificate IP SAN error

Use the VMware vCenter server fully-qualified host name instead of the IP address in the credential. You can also update the VMware vCenter CA certificate to contain the IP SAN. 

== Managed cluster creation fails with unknown certificate authority

[#symptom-vsphere-fails-cert-unknown-mce]
=== Symptom: Managed cluster creation fails with unknown certificate authority

After creating a new {ocp} cluster on VMware vSphere, the cluster fails because the certificate is signed by an unknown authority.

[#identifying-the-problem-vsphere-fails-cert-unknown-mce]
=== Identifying the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with unknown certificate authority

The deployment of the managed cluster fails and returns the following errors in the deployment log:

----

=== Resolving the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with unknown certificate authority

Ensure you entered the correct certificate from the certificate authority when creating the credential.

== Managed cluster creation fails with expired certificate

[#symptom-vsphere-fails-cert-expired-mce]
=== Symptom: Managed cluster creation fails with expired certificate

After creating a new {ocp} cluster on VMware vSphere, the cluster fails because the certificate is expired or is not yet valid.

[#identifying-the-problem-vsphere-fails-cert-expired-mce]
=== Identifying the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with expired certificate

The deployment of the managed cluster fails and returns the following errors in the deployment log:

----
x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid

=== Resolving the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with expired certificate

Ensure that the time on your ESXi hosts is synchronized.

== Managed cluster creation fails with insufficient privilege for tagging

[#symptom-vsphere-fails-tag-mce]
=== Symptom: Managed cluster creation fails with insufficient privilege for tagging

After creating a new {ocp} cluster on VMware vSphere, the cluster fails because there is insufficient privilege to use tagging.

[#identifying-the-problem-vsphere-fails-tag-mce]
=== Identifying the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with insufficient privilege for tagging

The deployment of the managed cluster fails and returns the following errors in the deployment log:

=== Resolving the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with insufficient privilege for tagging

Ensure that your VMware vCenter required account privileges are correct. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/installing_on_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned#registry-removed_installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned[Image registry removed during information] for more information. 

== Managed cluster creation fails with invalid dnsVIP

[#symptom-vsphere-fails-dnsvip-mce]
=== Symptom: Managed cluster creation fails with invalid dnsVIP

After creating a new {ocp} cluster on VMware vSphere, the cluster fails because there is an invalid dnsVIP.

[#identifying-the-problem-vsphere-fails-dnsvip-mce]
=== Identifying the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with invalid dnsVIP

If you see the following message when trying to deploy a new managed cluster with VMware vSphere, it is because you have an older {ocp-short} release image that does not support VMware Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI):

----
failed to fetch Master Machines: failed to load asset \\\"Install Config\\\": invalid \\\"install-config.yaml\\\" file: platform.vsphere.dnsVIP: Invalid value: \\\"\\\": \\\"\\\" is not a valid IP
----

[#resolving-the-problem-vsphere-fails-dnsvip-mce]
=== Resolving the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with invalid dnsVIP

Select a release image from a later version of {ocp-short} that supports VMware Installer Provisioned Infrastructure.  

== Managed cluster creation fails with incorrect network type

[#symptom-vsphere-fails-network-mce]
=== Symptom: Managed cluster creation fails with incorrect network type

After creating a new {ocp} cluster on VMware vSphere, the cluster fails because there is an incorrect network type specified.
