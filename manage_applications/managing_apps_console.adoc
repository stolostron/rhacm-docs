[#managing-applications-with-the-console]
= Managing applications with the console

You can use the console to create, manage, view details, and troubleshoot resources.

Samples for all resources are located in the xref:../manage_applications/app_sample.adoc#application-samples[Application resource samples] documentation.

The console includes different tools that each provide different application management capabilities.
These capabilities allow you to easily create, find, update, and deploy applications resources.

[#applications-dashboards]
== Applications dashboards

From the main _Applications_ dashboard, you can view information about all applications, and you can select and view information about a specific application.

From the _Overview_ tab on this dashboard, you can complete the following tasks for all applications:

* View a table that lists all applications.
* Use the _Find resources_ box to filter the applications that are listed.
* View the application name and namespace.
* View the number of managed clusters where the application is deployed through a subscription.
* View number of subscriptions on the _hub_ cluster that are used to deploy the application and the associated status.
* View the date when the application was created.
* Click *Options* for more actions, such as *Delete application*
* Click on an application name in the table to go to view more details about that specific resource.
* Access the resource pipeline from the _Resources_ tab.

From _Resources_, click on *Subscription* to see the _Search_ page, then see hub cluster subscriptions and all subscriptions that are deployed to managed clusters. Additionally, you can complete the following tasks:

* View the summary of resources for all applications on different cards. These resource summary cards show the following information about your applications and related managed clusters:

 ** The number of subscriptions on the hub cluster and the number of subscriptions that failed to deploy to the hub cluster.
 ** The total number of managed clusters.
 ** The number of subscriptions that are active for those managed clusters.
 ** The total number of channels and placement rules for all applications.

You can click each summary card to open the _Search_ page and display more information about the selected resource.

* From this page, you can also click the multiple *Create* options to create more resources with YAML editors. 

+ 
When you select to create any of these resources a YAML editor opens for you to use to define the resource. Default sample YAML content is included as templates to indicate the required fields to help you create any of these resource types.

+
View resources for all applications, which includes a table that displays details for your applications and other resources:

 ** Each row provides details for a single application. Rows are included for all of your applications.
If needed, you can use the search box to filter the application rows to find a matching application.
 ** Expand the row for each application to view more details for the associated channels, subscriptions, and placement rules, view related incidents, and view the status of resource (pod) deployments.
 ** Select an associated subscription for a channel and application to view more details about that subscription, including the subscribed deployables, the associated channel, namespace, and host-cluster, the status of any related resource (pod) deployments, and the placement settings that are used with the subscription.


[#application-dashboard-single-applications]
=== Application dashboard (single applications)

From the _Overview_ tab of the dashboard for a single application, you can complete the following tasks:

* View the summary of resource highlights for the application on different cards.
These resource summary cards show the following information:
 ** The number of subscriptions on the hub cluster for the application and the number of subscriptions that failed to deploy to the hub cluster.
 ** The total number of managed clusters where the application is used.
This card also shows the total number of subscriptions for the application on those managed clusters, and the number of subscriptions that failed to deploy to those managed clusters.
 ** The number of pods for the application, including the number that are running and failed.
 ** The number of policy violations and incidents that are related to the application.
You can click each summary card to open the _Search_ page and display more information about the selected resource.
* Select to view additional details for the application, including the application namespace, version, creation date, associated labels and annotations, and more.
* View the resource topology for the application that shows the application and related components such as channels, deployables, related services, pods, and placement rules.
You can select to edit the topology and update the YAML definitions for the application and related resources, such as to add, change, or remove resources.

From the _Resources_ tab for a single application, you can complete the following tasks:

* View the resource list for the application.
This list includes all resources that are associated with the application, including pods, secrets, services, and more.
This list indicates the name, namespace, kind, API groups, and status of each resource.
The list also indicates the cluster where the resource is deployed, the creation date of the resource, and the last date that the resource was updated.
* View the resource pipeline for the application, which includes the summary of the application resources, options to create resources, and a table that provides more details about the resources.
The resource pipeline for a single application includes similar information to the pipeline for all applications.
The difference between the two pipelines is that this pipeline is scoped to just the selected application.

[#search]
== Search

The console _Search_ page supports searching for application resources by the component `kind` for each resource.
To search for resources, use the following values:

|===
| Application resource | Kind (search parameter)

| Application
| `Application`

| Channel
| `Channel`

| Deployable
| `Deployable`

| Secret
| `Secret`

| Placement rule
| `PlacementRule`

| Subscription
| `Subscription`
|===

You can also search by other fields, including name, namespace, cluster, label, and more.

From the search results, you can view identifying details for each resource, including the name, namespace, cluster, labels, and creation date.

If needed, you can also expand the _Options_ menu in the search results for a resource to select to delete that resource.

By clicking the resource name in the search results, a YAML editor opens and displays the YAML definition for the resource.
You can choose to edit the definition within the editor.
Any changes that you save are applied to the resource immediately.

For more information about using search, see link:../console[Search in the console].

[#resource-topology] 
== Resource topology

The application topology includes a visualization of application cards that display status. The topology view for each application includes any services, deployments, charts, and pods for that application.

* You can hover your cursor over a resource to view the component kind, name, and namespace and links to view the search results for the resource or namespace.

* When you are viewing the details for a pod, you can select to view the logs for that pod.
