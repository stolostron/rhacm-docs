[#subscribing-git-resources]
= Subscribing Git resources 

By default, when a subscription deploys subscribed applications to target clusters, the applications are deployed to that subscription namespace, even if the application resources are associated with other namespaces. A subscription administrator can change default behavior, as described in this topic.

Additionally, if an application resource exists in the cluster and was not created by the subscription, the subscription cannot apply a new resource on that existing resource. See the following processes to change default settings as the subscription administrator:

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#granting-users-and-groups-subscription-admin-privilege]
== Granting users and groups subscription admin privilege

Learn how to grant subscription administrator access.

. From the console, log in to your {ocp} cluster.

. Create one or more users. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/post_installation_configuration/preparing-for-users.html[Preparing for users] for information about creating users.

+
Users that you create are administrators for the `app.open-cluster-management.io/subscription` application. With {ocp-short}, a subscription administrator can change default behavior. You can group these users to represent a subscription administrative group, which is demonstrated in later examples.

. From the terminal, log in to your {product-title-short} cluster.

. Add the following subjects into `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding with the following command:

+
----
oc edit clusterrolebinding open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
----

+

*Note:* Initially, `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding has no subject.

+
Your subjects might display as the following example:
+
----
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: example-name
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: example-group-name

[#creating-application-resources-git]
== Creating application resources in Git

You need to specify the full group and version for `apiVersion` in resource YAML when you subscribe. For example, if you subscribe to `apiVersion: v1`, the subscription controller fails to validate the subscription and you receive an error: `Resource /v1, Kind=ImageStream is not supported`. 

If the `apiVersion` is changed to `image.openshift.io/v1`, as in the following sample, it passes the validation in the subscription controller and the resource is applied successfully. 

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: `image.openshift.io/v1`
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
spec:
  lookupPolicy:
    local: true
  tags:
    - name: 'latest'
      from:
        kind: DockerImage
        name: 'quay.io/repository/open-cluster-management/multicluster-operators-subscription:community-latest'
----

Next, see more useful examples of how a subscription administrator can change default behavior.

[#namespace-example]
== Application namespace example

In this example, you are logged in as a subscription administrator. Create a subscription to subscribe the sample resource YAML file from a Git repository. The example file contains subscriptions that are located within the following different namespaces:

*Applicable channel types:* Git

* ConfigMap `test-configmap-1` gets created in `multins` namespace. 

* ConfigMap `test-configmap-2` gets created in `default` namespace.

* ConfigMap `test-configmap-3` gets created in the `subscription` namespace.
+
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: multins
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: multins
data:
  path: resource1
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-2
  namespace: default
data:
  path: resource2
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-3
data:
  path: resource3
----

If the subscription was created by other users, all the ConfigMaps get created in the same namespace as the subscription.

[#resource-overwrite-example]
== Resource overwrite example

*Applicable channel types:* Git, ObjectBucket (Object storage in the console)

In this example, the following ConfigMap already exists in the target cluster. 

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  name: user1
  age: 19
----

Subscribe the following sample resource YAML file from a Git repository and replace the existing ConfigMap. See the change in the `data` specification:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  age: 20
----

[#default-merge-option]
=== Default merge option

See the following sample resource YAML file from a Git repository with the default `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: merge` annotation. See the following example:

----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: subscription-example
  namespace: sub-ns
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: sample-resources
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: merge
spec:
  channel: channel-ns/somechannel
  placement:
    placementRef:
      name: dev-clusters
----

When this subscription is created by a subscription administrator and subscribes the ConfigMap resource, the existing ConfigMap is merged, as you can see in the following example:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  name: user1
  age: 20
----

When the `merge` option is used, entries from subscribed resource are either created or updated in the existing resource. No entry is removed from the existing resource.

*Important:* If the existing resource you want to overwrite with a subscription is automatically reconciled by another operator or controller, the resource configuration is updated by both subscription and the controller or operator. Do not use this method in this case.

[#replace-option]
=== Replace option

You log in as a subscription administrator and create a subscription with `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: replace` annotation. See the following example:

----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: subscription-example
  namespace: sub-ns
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: sample-resources
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: replace
spec:
  channel: channel-ns/somechannel
  placement:
    placementRef:
      name: dev-clusters
----

When this subscription is created by a subscription administrator and subscribes the ConfigMap resource, the existing ConfigMap is replaced by the following:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: sub-ns
data:
  age: 20
----

[#reconcile-option]
=== Reconcile option

You can also use `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option` annotation in individual resources to override the subscription-level reconcile option. 

For example, if you add `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: replace` annotation in the subscription and add `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: merge` annotation in a resource YAML in the subscribed Git repository, the resource will be merged on the target cluster while other resources replaced.

[#reconcile-frequency]
==== Reconcile frequency

You can now select reconcile frequency options: `high`, `medium`, `low`, and `off` in channel configuration to avoid unnecessary resource reconciliations and therefore prevent overload on subscription operator.

*Required access:* Administrator and cluster administrator

See the following definitions of the `settings:attribute:<value>`:

- `Off`: The deployed resources are not automatically reconciled. A change in the subscription custom resource triggers a reconciliation. You can add or update a label or annotation.
- `Low`: The deployed resources are automatically reconciled every hour, even if there is no change in the source Git repository.
- `Medium`: This is the default setting. The subscription operator compares the currently deployed commit ID to the latest commit ID of the source repository every 3 minutes and apply changes to target clusters when there is change. Every 15 minutes, all resources are re-applied from the source Git repository to the target clusters, even if there is no change in the repository.
- `High`: The deployed resources are automatically reconciled every two minutes, even if there is no change in the source Git repository.

You can set this using `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-rate` annotation in the channel custom resource that is referenced by subscription. 

See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: git-channel
  namespace: sample
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-rate: <value from the list>
spec:
  type: GitHub
  pathname: <Git URL>
---
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: git-subscription
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: <application1>
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-branch: <branch1>
spec:
  channel: sample/git-channel
  placement:
    local: true
----

In the previous example, all subscriptions that use `sample/git-channel` get `low` reconciliation frequency. 

Regardless of the `reconcile-rate` setting in the channel, a subscription can turn the auto-reconciliation `off` by specifying `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-rate: off` annotation in the subscription CR. 

See the following sample: 

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: git-channel
  namespace: sample
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-rate: high
spec:
  type: GitHub
  pathname: <Git URL>
---
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: git-subscription
  annotations:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-path: application1
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/git-branch: branch1
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-rate: "off"
spec:
  channel: sample/git-channel
  placement:
    local: true
----

See that the resources deployed by `git-subscription` are never automatically reconciled even if the `reconcile-rate` is set to `high` in the channel.
