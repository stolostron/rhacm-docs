= Delete a placement rule

To delete a placement rule that is a separate resource, you can use the console, the Kubernetes command line interface (`kubectl`) tool, or REST API.

To use the console, complete the following procedure:

. From the navigation, click on *Manage applications*.
. Click the *Resources* tab.
. Find your subscription resource card for the placement rule that you want to delete.
. Click *Options* for more actions. 
. Click *Delete placement rule*
. Verify when the list of all subscriptions is refreshed that the placement rule is no longer displayed.

To use the Kubernetes CLI tool, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command to delete the placement rule from a target namespace.
. Replace `name` and `namespace` with the name of your placement rule and your target namespace:
+
----
kubectl delete PlacementRule <name> -n <namespace>
----

. Verify that your placement rule resource is deleted by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get PlacementRule <name>
----

To use REST API, you need to use the placement rule DELETE API. See link:../apis/api.adoc#apis[APIs].
