[#placement-rule-samples]
= Placement rule samples

Placement rules (`placementrule.apps.open-cluster-management.io`) define the target clusters where deployables can be deployed. Use placement rules to help you facilitate the multi-cluster deployment of your deployables.

To use the Kubernetes CLI tool, see the following procedure:

.. Compose and save your application YAML file with your preferred editing tool.
.. Run the following command to apply your file to an apiserver. Replace `filename` with the name of your file:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f filename.yaml
----

.. Verify that your application resource is created by running the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get Application
----

[#placement-rule-yaml-structure]
== Placement rule YAML structure

The following YAML structure shows the required fields for a placement rule and some of the common optional fields.
Your YAML structure needs to include some required fields and values.
Depending on your application management requirements, you might need to include other optional fields and values.
You can compose your own YAML content with any tool.

| Required.
The name for identifying the placement rule.

| metadata.namespace
| Required.
The namespace resource to use for the placement rule.

| metadata.resourceVersion
| Optional.
The version of the placement rule resource.

| metadata.labels
| Optional.
The labels for the placement rule.

| spec.clusterSelector
| Optional.
The labels for identifying the target clusters
