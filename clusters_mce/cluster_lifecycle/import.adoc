= Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster

You can import clusters from different Kubernetes cloud providers. After you import, the targeted cluster becomes a managed cluster for the {mce} hub cluster. Unless otherwise specified, complete the import tasks anywhere that you can access the hub cluster and the targeted managed cluster.

A hub cluster cannot manage _any_ other hub cluster, but can manage itself. The hub cluster is configured to automatically be imported and self-managed. You do not need to manually import the hub cluster. 

However, if you remove a hub cluster and try to import it again, you need to add the `local-cluster:true` label to the `ManagedCluster` resource.

Choose from the following instructions to set up your managed cluster, either from the console or from the CLI:

*Required user type or access level*: Cluster administrator
