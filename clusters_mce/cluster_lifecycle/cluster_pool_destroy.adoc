= Destroying a cluster pool

//UI

If you created a cluster pool and determine that you no longer need it, you can destroy the cluster pool. When you destroy a cluster pool, all of the unclaimed hibernating clusters are destroyed and their resources are released.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

To destroy a cluster pool, complete the following steps: 

. From the navigation menu, click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the _Cluster pools_ tab.

. In the _Options_ menu for the cluster pool that you want to delete, select *Destroy cluster pool*. Any unclaimed clusters in the cluster pool are destroyed. It might take some time for all of the resources to be deleted, and the cluster pool remains visible in the console until all of the resources are deleted. 
+
The namespace that contained the ClusterPool will not be deleted. Deleting the namespace will destroy any clusters that have been claimed from the ClusterPool, since the ClusterClaim resources for these clusters are created in the same namespace.

*Tip:* You can destroy multiple cluster pools with one action by selecting the box for each of the the cluster pools and using the _Actions_ menu to destroy the selected cluster pools.
