= Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets

A `ManagedClusterSet` is a group of managed clusters. With a managed cluster set, you can manage access to all of the managed clusters in the group together. You can also create a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource to bind a `ManagedClusterSet` resource to a namespace.

Each managed cluster must be a member of a managed cluster set. When you install the hub cluster, a default `ManagedClusterSet` resource is created called `default`. All managed clusters that are not specifically assigned to a managed cluster set are automatically assigned to the `default` managed cluster set. To ensure that the default managed cluster set is always available, you cannot delete or update the `default` managed cluster set.

**Note:** Cluster pools that are not specifically added to a managed cluster set are not added to the default `ManagedClusterSet` resource. After a managed cluster is claimed from the cluster pool, the managed cluster is added to the default `ManagedClusterSet`.

[#managedclustersets_global]
== Global ManagedClusterSet

When you create a managed cluster, the following are automatically created to ease management:

* A `ManagedClusterSet` called `global`.
* The namespace called `open-cluster-management-global-set`.
* A `ManagedClusterSetBinding` called `global` to bind the `global` `ManagedClusterSet` to the `open-cluster-management-global-set` namespace.
+
**Important:** You cannot delete, update, or edit the `global` managed cluster set. The `global` managed cluster set includes all managed clusters. See the following example:
