= Assigning users or groups Role-Based Access Control permissions to your ManagedClusterSet

You can assign users or groups to your cluster set that are provided by the configured identity providers on the hub cluster.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

The `ManagedClusterSet` API offers three levels of RBAC permissions:

* Cluster set `admin`
** Full access permissions to all of the cluster and cluster pool resources that are assigned to the managed cluster set.
** Permission to create clusters, import clusters, and create cluster pools. The permissions must be assigned to the managed cluster set when the managed cluster set is created.
* Cluster set `bind`
** Permission to bind the cluster set to a namespace by creating a `ManagedClusterSetBinding`. The user or group must also have permission to create the `ManagedClusterSetBinding` in the target namespace.
** Read only permissions to all of the cluster and cluster pool resources that are assigned to the managed cluster set.
** No permission to create clusters, import clusters, or create cluster pools.
* Cluster set `view`
** Read only permissions to all of the cluster and cluster pool resources that are assigned to the managed cluster set.
** No permission to create clusters, import clusters, or create cluster pools.

**Note:** You cannot apply the Cluster set `admin` permission for the global cluster set.

Complete the following steps to assign users or groups to your managed cluster set from the console:

. From the main navigation menu of the console, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the _Cluster sets_ tab.

. Select your target cluster set. 

. Select the _Access management_ tab. 

. Select *Add user or group*.

. Search for, and select the user or group that you want to provide access.

. Select the *Cluster set admin* or *Cluster set view* role to give to the selected user or user group. See _Overview of roles_ in link:../about/mce_rbac.adoc#mce-rbac[{mce} Role-based access control] for more information.

. Select *Add* to submit the changes.

Your user or group is displayed in the table. It might take a few seconds for the permission assignments for all of the managed cluster set resources to be propagated to your user or group.

See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/placement_managed.adoc#placement-managed[Using ManagedClusterSets with Placement] for placement information.
