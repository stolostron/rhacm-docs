[#placement-managed]
= Using ManagedClusterSets with Placement

A `Placement` resource is a namespace-scoped resource that defines a rule to select a set of `ManagedClusters` from the `ManagedClusterSets`, which are bound to the placement namespace.

**Required access**: Cluster administrator, Cluster set administrator

[#placement-overview]
== Placement overview

See the following information about how placement with managed clusters works:

* Kubernetes clusters are registered with the hub cluster as cluster-scoped `ManagedClusters`.

* The `ManagedClusters` are organized into cluster-scoped `ManagedClusterSets`.

* The `ManagedClusterSets` are bound to workload namespaces.

* The namespace-scoped `Placements` specify a portion of `ManagedClusterSets` that select a working set of the potential `ManagedClusters`.

* `Placements` filter `ManagedClusters` from the managed cluster set by using label and claim selectors.

* The placement of `ManagedClusters` can be controlled by using taints and tolerations. See xref:../cluster_lifecycle/taints_tolerations.adoc#taints-tolerations-managed[Using taints and tolerations to place managed clusters] for more information.

* `Placements` rank the clusters by the requirements and select a subset of clusters from them.

*Notes:* 

* You need to bind at least one `ManagedClusterSet` to a namespace by creating a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` in that namespace. 
* You need role-based access to `CREATE` on the virtual sub-resource of `managedclustersets/bind`.

See xref:../cluster_mce/api/placement.json.adoc#placements-api[Placements API] to know more details about the API.

[#placement-labelselector-claimSelector]
== Placement LabelSelector and ClaimSelector

- You can select `ManagedClusters` with the `labelSelector`. See the following sample where the `labelSelector` only matches clusters with label `vendor: OpenShift`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  predicates:
    - requiredClusterSelector:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            vendor: OpenShift

----

- You can select `ManagedClusters` with `claimSelector`. See the following sample where `claimSelector` only matches clusters with `region.open-cluster-management.io` with `us-west-1`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  predicates:
    - requiredClusterSelector:
        claimSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: region.open-cluster-management.io
              operator: In
              values:
                - us-west-1
----

- You can select `ManagedClusters` from particular `clusterSets`. See the following sample where `claimSelector` only matches `clusterSets:` `clusterset1` `clusterset2`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  clusterSets:
    - clusterset1
    - clusterset2
  predicates:
    - requiredClusterSelector:
        claimSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: region.open-cluster-management.io
              operator: In
              values:
                - us-west-1
----

- Select desired number of `ManagedClusters`. See the following sample where `numberOfClusters` is `3`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement

        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            vendor: OpenShift
        claimSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: region.open-cluster-management.io
              operator: In
              values:
                - us-west-1
----

[#placement-tolerations]
== Placement Tolerations

- Select `ManagedClusters` with matching taints. 

Suppose your managed cluster has a taint as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: cluster1
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
  taints:
    - effect: NoSelect
      key: gpu
      value: "true"
      timeAdded: '2022-02-21T08:11:06Z'
----

By default, the placement cannot select this cluster unless you define tolerations, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: gpu
      value: "true"
      operator: Equal
----

- Select `ManagedClusters` with matching taints for a specified period of time.

The value of `TolerationSeconds` represents the length of time that the toleration tolerates the taint, is useful when a managed cluster is offline, users can make applications deployed on this cluster to be transferred to another available managed cluster after a tolerated time. The `TolerationSeconds` can automatically transfer applications that are deployed on a cluster that goes offline to another managed cluster after a specified length of time.

For example, the managed cluster that is defined by the following example content becomes unreachable:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: cluster1
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
  taints:
    - effect: NoSelect
      key: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/unreachable
      timeAdded: '2022-02-21T08:11:06Z'
----

If you define a placement with `TolerationSeconds` as shown in the following example, the workload is transferred to another available managed cluster after 5 minutes.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/unreachable
      operator: Exists
      tolerationSeconds: 300
----

[#placement-prioritizerpolicy]
== Placement PrioritizerPolicy

- Select a cluster with the largest allocatable memory.

[#placement-decision]
== Placement decision

One or multiple `PlacementDecisions` with label `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement name}` are created to represent the `ManagedClusters` selected by a `Placement`.

If a `ManagedCluster` is selected and added to a `PlacementDecision`, components that consume this `Placement` might apply the workload on this `ManagedCluster`. After the `ManagedCluster` is no longer selected and is removed from the `PlacementDecisions`, the workload that is applied on this `ManagedCluster` should be removed.

See xref:../cluster_mce/api/placementdecision.json.adoc#placementdecisions-api[PlacementDecisions API] to know more details about the API.

See the following `PlacementDecision` sample:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: PlacementDecision
metadata:
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement: placement1

[#addon-status]
== Add-on status

You might want to select managed clusters for your placements according to the status of the add-ons that are deployed on them. For example, you want to select a managed cluster for your placement only if there is a specific add-on that is enabled on the cluster. 

Specify the label for the add-on, as well as its status, when you create the Placement. A label is automatically created on a `ManagedCluster` resource if an add-on is enabled on the cluster. The label is automatically removed if the add-on is disabled.

Each add-on is represented by a label in the format of `feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-<addon_name>=<status_of_addon>`. 

Replace `addon_name` with the name of the add-on that should be enabled on the managed cluster that you want to select. 

Replace `status_of_addon` with the status that the add-on should have if the cluster is selected. The possible values of `status_of_addon` are in the following list:

* `available`: The add-on is enabled and available.
* `unhealthy`: The add-on is enabled, but the lease is not updated continuously.
* `unreachable`: The add-on is enabled, but there is no lease found for it. This can also be caused when the managed cluster is offline.

For example, an available `application-manager` add-on is represented by a label on the managed cluster that reads:

----
feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-application-manager: available
----

See the following examples of creating placements based on add-ons and their status:

- You can create a placement that includes all managed clusters that have `application-manager` enabled on them by adding the following YAML content:
