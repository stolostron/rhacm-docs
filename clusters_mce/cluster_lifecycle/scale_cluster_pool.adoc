= Scaling cluster pools (Technology Preview)

You can change the number of clusters in the cluster pool by increasing or decreasing the number of clusters in the cluster pool size.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

Complete the following steps to change the number of clusters in your cluster pool:

. From the navigation menu, click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the _Cluster pools_ tab.

. In the _Options_ menu for the cluster pool that you want to change, select *Scale cluster pool*.

. Change the value of the pool size.

. Optionally, you can update the number of running clusters to increase or decrease the number of clusters that are immediately available when you claim them.

Your cluster pools are scaled to reflect your new values.
