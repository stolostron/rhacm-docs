= Troubleshooting imported clusters offline after certificate change

Installing a custom `apiserver` certificate is supported, but one or more clusters that were imported before you changed the certificate information can have an `offline` status. 

[#symptom-clusters-offline-after-certificate-change-mce]
== Symptom: Clusters offline after certificate change

After you complete the procedure for updating a certificate secret, one or more of your clusters that were online are now displaying an `offline` status in the console.

== Identifying the problem: Clusters offline after certificate change 

After updating the information for a custom API server certificate, clusters that were imported and running before the new certificate are now in an `offline` state. 

The errors that indicate that the certificate is the problem are found in the logs for the pods in the `open-cluster-management-agent` namespace of the offline managed cluster. The following examples are similar to the errors that are displayed in the logs:

[#resolving-clusters-offline-after-certificate-change-mce]
== Resolving the problem: Clusters offline after certificate change

To manually restore your clusters after updating your certificate information, complete the following steps for each managed cluster:

. Manually import the cluster again. {ocp} clusters that were created by using multicluster engine will resynchronize every 2 hours, so you can skip this step for those clusters.
.. On the hub cluster, display the import command by entering the following command:
+ 
----
oc get secret -n ${CLUSTER_NAME} ${CLUSTER_NAME}-import -ojsonpath='{.data.import\.yaml}' | base64 --decode  > import.yaml
----
+
Replace _CLUSTER_NAME_ with the name of the managed cluster that you are importing.
.. On the managed cluster, apply the `import.yaml` file:
+
----
oc apply -f import.yaml
