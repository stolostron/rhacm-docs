== Resolving the problem: Missing PlacementDecision after creating Placement

To resolve the issue, complete the following steps:

. Check the `Placement` conditions by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl describe placement <placement-name> 
----
+
Replace `placement-name` with the name of the `Placement`.
+
The output might resemble the following example:
+
----
Name:         demo-placement
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

    Status:                     False
    Type:                       PlacementMisconfigured

    Message:                    No valid ManagedClusterSetBindings found in placement namespace
    Reason:                     NoManagedClusterSetBindings
    Status:                     False
    Type:                       PlacementSatisfied
  Number Of Selected Clusters:  0
----

. Check the output for the `Status` of `PlacementMisconfigured` and `PlacementSatisfied`:
+
* If the `PlacementMisconfigured` `Status` is true, your `Placement` has configuration errors. Check the included message for more details on the configuration errors and how to resolve them.
* If the `PlacementSatisfied` `Status` is false, no managed cluster satisfies your `Placement`. Check the included message for more details and how to resolve the error. In the previous example, no `ManagedClusterSetBindings` were found in the placement namespace.

. You can check the score of each cluster in `Events` to find out why some clusters with lower scores are not selected. The output might resemble the following example:
+

*Note:* The placement controller assigns a score and generates an event for each filtered `ManagedCluster`. The placement controller genereates a new event when the cluster score changes.
