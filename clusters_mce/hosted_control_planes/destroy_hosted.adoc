[#destroy-hosted-control-planes]
= Destroying hosted clusters

Destroying hosted clusters does not disable the hosted control plane features. If you want to disable the feature, you must first destroy both the hosted cluster and the managed cluster resource on {mce}. Destroying only the hosted cluster, or only the managed cluster resource, might cause issues when you create the hosted cluster again, or if you are using the same managed cluster name.

Replace names where necessary.

. Delete the managed cluster resource on {mce} by running the following command:
