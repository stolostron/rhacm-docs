= Hosted control planes (Technology Preview)

{mce} {mce-version} can deploy {ocp} clusters by using two different control plane configurations: standalone or hosted control planes. The standalone configuration uses multiple dedicated virtual machines or physical machines to host the {ocp-short} control plane. You can create hosted control planes to create the {ocp-short} control plane as pods on a hosting cluster without the need for dedicated physical machines for each control plane.

Amazon Web Services is supported as a Technology Preview. You can host the control planes for your {ocp} version 4.10.7 and later.

*Best practice:* Be sure to run the hub cluster and workers on the same platform for hosted control planes.

The control plane runs as pods that are contained in a single namespace and is associated with the hosted control plane cluster. When {ocp-short} creates this type of hosted cluster, it creates a worker node that is independent of the control plane. 

Hosted control plane clusters offer several advantages:

* Saves cost by removing the need to host dedicated control plane nodes

* Introduces separation between the control plane and the workloads, which improves isolation and reduces configuration errors that can require changes

* Decreases the cluster creation time by removing the requirement for control plane node bootstrapping

* Supports turn-key deployments or fully customized {ocp-short} provisioning
