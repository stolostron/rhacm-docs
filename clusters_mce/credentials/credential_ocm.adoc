= Creating a credential for Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager

Add an {ocm} credential so that you can discover clusters.

**Required access**: Administrator

[#prerequisites-discovery]
== Prerequisites

You need access to a https://console.redhat.com/[console.redhat.com] account. Later you will need the value that can be obtained from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[console.redhat.com/openshift/token].

[#create-ocm-credential]
== Managing a credential by using the console

You need to add your credential to discover clusters. To create a credential from the {mce} console, complete the steps in the console. 

Start at the navigation menu. Click *Credentials* to choose from existing credential options. *Tip:* Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, both for convenience and added security.

Your {ocm} API token can be obtained from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[console.redhat.com/openshift/token].

You can edit your credential in the console. 

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential. Select *Actions* to delete in bulk, or select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.

If your credential is removed, or your {ocm} API token expires or is revoked, then the associated discovered clusters are removed.
