= Requirements and recommendations

Before you install the {mce}, review the following system configuration requirements and settings:

* <<supported-browsers-platforms,Supported browsers and platforms>>
* <<network-configuration,Network configuration>>

*Important:* You must install {mce-short} on a cluster that does not have {product-title} earlier than 2.5 installed. If you are using {product-title-short} version 2.5 or later, then multicluster engine for Kubernetes is already installed on the cluster with it.

[#supported-browsers-platforms]
== Supported browsers and platforms 

See important information about supported browsers and features in the https://access.redhat.com/articles/6973062[The multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator 2.1 support matrix].

[#network-configuration]
== Network configuration

**Important:** The trusted CA bundle is available in the {mce-short} namespace, but that enhancement requires changes to your network. The trusted CA bundle ConfigMap uses the default name of `trusted-ca-bundle`. You can change this name by providing it to the operator in an environment variable named `TRUSTED_CA_BUNDLE`. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy#nw-proxy-configure-object_config-cluster-wide-proxy[Configuring the cluster-wide proxy] in the _Networking_ section of {ocp} for more information.

Configure your network settings to allow the connections in the following sections:
