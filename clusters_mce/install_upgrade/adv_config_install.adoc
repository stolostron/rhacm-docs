[#advanced-config-engine]
= Advanced configuration 

The {mce} is installed using an operator that deploys all of the required components. The {mce} can be further configured during or after installation by adding one or more of the following attributes to the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource:

[#local-cluster]
== Local-cluster enablement

A _managed_ hub cluster is named a `local-cluster`. If you want the hub cluster to manage itself, you need to change the setting for `spec.
disableHubSelfManagement` to `true` to import the existing cluster as a `local-cluster`. 

If the setting is not included in the YAML file that defines the custom resource, you need to add it. The hub cluster can only be managed with this option. 

. Create a YAML file named `import-hub.yaml` that is similar to the following example of the default template to use. Replace `namespace` with the name of your project:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  labels:
    local-cluster: "true"
    cloud: auto-detect
    vendor: auto-detect
  name: local-cluster
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
  leaseDurationSeconds: 60
----

. Run the following command to apply the file:
+
----
oc apply -f import-hub.yaml
----

A hub cluster that is managed by itself is designated as the `local-cluster` in the list of clusters. 

[#custom-image-pull-secret]
== Custom image pull secret

If you plan to import Kubernetes clusters that were not created by OpenShift Container Platform or the {mce}, generate a secret that contains your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret information to access the entitled content from the distribution registry. 

The secret requirements for OpenShift Container Platform clusters are automatically resolved by OpenShift Container Platform and multicluster engine for Kubernetes, so you do not have to create the secret if you are not importing other types of Kubernetes clusters to be managed.

*Important:* These secrets are namespace-specific, so make sure that you are in the namespace that you use for your engine.

 . Download your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret file from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret] by selecting *Download pull secret*. Your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret is associated with your Red Hat Customer Portal ID, and is the same across all Kubernetes providers.

 . Run the following command to create your secret:
+
----
oc create secret generic <secret> -n <namespace> --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path-to-pull-secret> --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
+
- Replace `secret` with the name of the secret that you want to create.
- Replace `namespace` with your project namespace, as the secrets are namespace-specific.
- Replace `path-to-pull-secret` with the path to your OpenShift Container Platform pull secret that you downloaded.

The following example displays the `spec.imagePullSecret` template to use if you want to use a custom pull secret. Replace `secret` with the name of your pull secret:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  imagePullSecret: <secret>
----

[#target-namespace]
== Target namespace

The operands can be installed in a designated namespace by specifying a location in the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource. This namespace is created upon application of the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource.

*Important:* If no target namespace is specified, the operator will install to the `multicluster-engine` namespace and will set it in the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource specification.

The following example displays the `spec.targetNamespace` template that you can use to specify a target namespace. Replace `target` with the name of your destination namespace. *Note:* The `target` namespace cannot be the `default` namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  targetNamespace: <target>
----

[#availability-config]
== availabilityConfig

The hub cluster has two availabilities: `High` and `Basic`. By default, the hub cluster has an availability of `High`, which gives hub cluster components a `replicaCount` of `2`. This provides better support in cases of failover but consumes more resources than the `Basic` availability, which gives components a `replicaCount` of `1`.

The following examples shows the `spec.availabilityConfig` template with `Basic` availability:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  availabilityConfig: "Basic"
----

[#node-selector]
== nodeSelector

You can define a set of node selectors in the `MultiClusterEngine` to install to specific nodes on your cluster. The following example shows `spec.nodeSelector` to assign pods to nodes with the label `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
----

[#tolerations]
== tolerations

You can define a list of tolerations to allow the `MultiClusterEngine` to tolerate specific taints defined on the cluster. The following example shows a `spec.tolerations` that matches a `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` taint:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
    effect: NoSchedule
    operator: Exists
----

The previous infra-node toleration is set on pods by default without specifying any tolerations in the configuration. Customizing tolerations in the configuration will replace this default behavior.

[#serviceaccount-addon-intro]
== ManagedServiceAccount add-on (Technology Preview)

By default, the `Managed-ServiceAccount` add-on is disabled. This component when enabled allows you to create or delete a service account on a managed cluster. To install with this add-on enabled, include the following in the `MultiClusterEngine` specification in `spec.overrides`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  overrides:
    components:
    - name: managedserviceaccount-preview
      enabled: true
----

The `Managed-ServiceAccount` add-on can be enabled after creating `MultiClusterEngine` by editing the resource on the command line and setting the `managedserviceaccount-preview` component to `enabled: true`. Alternatively, you can run the following command and replace <multiclusterengine-name> with the name of your `MultiClusterEngine` resource.

----
oc patch MultiClusterEngine <multiclusterengine-name> --type=json -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/overrides/components/-","value":{"name":"managedserviceaccount-preview","enabled":true}}]'
----

[#hypershift-addon-intro]
== Hypershift add-on (Technology Preview)

By default, the `Hypershift` add-on is disabled. To install with this add-on enabled, include the following in the `MultiClusterEngine` values in `spec.overrides`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  overrides:
    components:
    - name: hypershift-preview
      enabled: true
----

The `Hypershift` add-on can be enabled after creating `MultiClusterEngine` by editing the resource on the command line, setting the `hypershift-preview` component to `enabled: true`. Alternatively, you can run the following command and replace <multiclusterengine-name> with the name of your `MultiClusterEngine` resource:

----
oc patch MultiClusterEngine <multiclusterengine-name> --type=json -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/overrides/components/-","value":{"name":"hypershift-preview","enabled":true}}]'
----
