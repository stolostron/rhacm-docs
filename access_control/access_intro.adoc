= Access control

Access control might need to manually be created and managed. You must configure _authentication_ service requirements for {acm} to onboard workloads to Identity and Access Management (IAM). For more information, see _Understanding authentication_ in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/authentication_and_authorization/understanding-authentication[Understanding authentication] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

Role-based access control and authentication identifies the user associated roles and cluster credentials. See the following documentation for information about access and credentials.
