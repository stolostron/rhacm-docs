[#rbac-rhacm]
= Role-based access control

{acm} supports role-based access control (RBAC). Your role determines the actions that you can perform. RBAC is based on the authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes, similar to {ocp}. For more information about RBAC, see the OpenShift _RBAC_ overview in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/authentication_and_authorization/using-rbac[{ocp-short} documentation].

*Note:* Action buttons are disabled from the console if the user-role access is impermissible.

[#overview-of-roles]
== Overview of roles

Some product resources are cluster-wide and some are namespace-scoped. You must apply cluster role bindings and namespace role bindings to your users for consistent access controls. View the table list of the following role definitions that are supported in {acm}:

.Role definition table
|===
| Role | Definition
| `cluster-admin`
| This is an {ocp-short} default role. A user with cluster binding to the `cluster-admin` role is an {ocp-short} super user, who has all access. 
| `open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin`
| A user with cluster binding to the `open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin` role is a {acm} super user, who has all access. This role allows the user to create a `ManagedCluster` resource.

| `open-cluster-management:admin:<managed_cluster_name>`
| A user with cluster binding to the `open-cluster-management:admin:<managed_cluster_name>` role has administrator access to the `ManagedCluster` resource named,  `<managed_cluster_name>`. When a user has a managed cluster, this role is automatically created.

| `open-cluster-management:view:<managed_cluster_name>`
| A user with cluster binding to the `open-cluster-management:view:<managed_cluster_name>` role has view access to the `ManagedCluster` resource named,  `<managed_cluster_name>`.

| `open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:admin:<managed_clusterset_name>`
| A user with cluster binding to the `open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:admin:<managed_clusterset_name>` role has administrator access to `ManagedCluster` resource named `<managed_clusterset_name>`. The user also has administrator access to `managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, `clusterclaim.hive.openshift.io`, `clusterdeployment.hive.openshift.io`, and `clusterpool.hive.openshift.io` resources, which has the managed cluster set label: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=<managed_clusterset_name>`. A role binding is automatically generated when you are using a cluster set. See link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/create_clusterset.adoc#creating-a-managedclusterset[Creating a _ManagedClusterSet_] to learn how to manage the resource. 

| `open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:view:<managed_clusterset_name>`
| A user with cluster binding to the `open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:view:<managed_clusterset_name>` role has view access to the `ManagedCluster` resource named, <managed_clusterset_name>`. The user also has view access to `managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, `clusterclaim.hive.openshift.io`, `clusterdeployment.hive.openshift.io`, and `clusterpool.hive.openshift.io` resources, which has the managed cluster set labels: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, `clusterset=<managed_clusterset_name>`. For more details on how to manage managed cluster set resources, see link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/create_clusterset.adoc#creating-a-managedclusterset[Creating a _ManagedClusterSet_].

| `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin`
| A user with the `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` role can create Git subscriptions that deploy resources to multiple namespaces. The resources are specified in Kubernetes resource YAML files in the subscribed Git repository. *Note:* When a non-subscription-admin user creates a subscription, all resources are deployed into the subscription namespace regardless of specified namespaces in the resources. For more information, see the xref:../access_control/rbac_implement_rhacm.adoc#application-lifecycle-RBAC[Application lifecycle RBAC] section.

| admin, edit, view
| Admin, edit, and view are {ocp-short} default roles. A user with a namespace-scoped binding to these roles has access to `open-cluster-management` resources in a specific namespace, while cluster-wide binding to the same roles gives access to all of the `open-cluster-management` resources cluster-wide.

| `open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:bind:<managed_clusterset_name>`
| A user with the `open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:bind:<managed_clusterset_name>` role has view access to the managed cluster resource called `<managed_clusterset_name>`. The user can bind `<managed_clusterset_name>` to a namespace. The user also has view access to `managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, `clusterclaim.hive.openshift.io`, `clusterdeployment.hive.openshift.io`, and `clusterpool.hive.openshift.io` resources, which have the following managed cluster set label: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=<managed_clusterset_name>`. See link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/create_clusterset.adoc#creating-a-managedclusterset[Creating a _ManagedClusterSet_] to learn how to manage the resource. 
|===

*Important:*

* Any user can create projects from {ocp-short}, which gives administrator role permissions for the namespace.

* If a user does not have role access to a cluster, the cluster name is not displayed. The cluster name might be displayed with the following symbol: `-`.

See xref:../access_control/rbac_implement_rhacm.adoc#rhacm-rbac-implement[Implementing role-based access control] for more details.
