[#role-based-access-control]
= Role-based access control

{product-title} supports role-based access control (RBAC). Your role determines the actions that you can perform. RBAC is based on the authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes, similar to {ocp}. For more information about RBAC, see the OpenShift _RBAC_ overview in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/authentication/using-rbac.html[{ocp-short} documentation].

*Note*: Action buttons are disabled from the console if the user-role access is impermissible.

View the following sections for details of supported RBAC by component:

* <<governance-lifecycle-RBAC,Governance lifecycle RBAC>>
* <<observability-RBAC,Observability RBAC>>

[#overview-of-roles]
== Overview of roles

Some product resources are cluster-wide and some are namespace-scoped. You must apply cluster role bindings and namespace role bindings to your users for consistent access controls. View the table list of the following role definitions that are supported in {product-title}:

RBAC is validated at the console level and at the API level. Actions in the console can be enabled or disabled based on user access role permissions. View the following sections for more information on RBAC for specific lifecycles in the product.

[#application-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Application lifecycle RBAC

When you create an application, the `_subscription_` namespace is created and the configuration map is created in the `_subscription_` namespace. You must also have access to the `_channel_` namespace. When you want to apply a subscription, you must be a subscription administrator. For more information on managing applications, see link:../applications/allow_deny.adoc#creating-allow-deny-list[Creating an allow and deny list as subscription administrator]. 

View the following application lifecycle RBAC operations:

* To create and administer application on all managed clusters with a user named `username`:

** Create a cluster role binding to the `open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin` cluster role and bind it to `username`, run the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin --user=<username>
----
+
This role is a super user, which has access to all resources and actions. You can create the namespace for the application and all application resources in the namespace with this role.

* *Option*: You can create applications that deploy resources to multiple namespaces:

** Create a cluster role binding to the `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` cluster role, and bind it to a user named `username`. Run the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:subscription-admin --user=<username>
----

* To create and administer an application named `application-name` in the `cluster-name` managed cluster, with `username` user:

** Create a cluster role binding to the `open-cluster-management:admin:` cluster role and bind it to `username` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:admin:<cluster-name> --user=<username>
----
+
This role has read and write access to all `application` resources on the managed cluster, `cluster-name`. Repeat this if access for other managed clusters is required.

** Create a namespace role binding to the `application` namespace using the `admin` role and bind it to `username` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <application-namespace> --clusterrole=admin --user=<username>
----
+
This role has read and write access to all `application` resources in the `application` namspace. Repeat this if access for other applications is required or if the application deploys to multiple namespaces.

* *Option*: You can create applications that deploy resources to multiple namespaces:

** Create a cluster role binding to the open-cluster-management:subscription-admin cluster role and bind it to `username` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:subscription-admin --user=<username>
----

* To view an application on a managed cluster named `cluster-name` with the user named `username`:

** Create a cluster role binding to the `open-cluster-management:view:` cluster role  and bind it to `username` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:view:<cluster-name> --user=<username>
----
+
This role has read access to all `application` resources on the managed cluster, `cluster-name`. Repeat this if access for other managed clusters is required.

** Create a namespace role binding to the `application` namespace using the `view` role and bind it to `username`. Enter the following command:
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <application-namespace> --clusterrole=view --user=<username>
----
+
This role has read access to all `application` resources in the `application` namspace. Repeat this if access for other applications is required.

[#governance-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Governance lifecycle RBAC

When a policy is created, the policy is created in the cluster. Roles for the governance lifecycle are namespace-scoped. A user must also have access to the managed cluster. 

To perform governance lifecycle operations, users must have access to the namespace where the policy is created, along with access to the managed cluster where the policy is applied.

View the following examples:

* To create a policy in the `policy` namespace and apply it in a managed cluster named `cluster-name`:

** Create a namespace role binding to the `policy` namespace using the `open-cluster-management:admin:` role. Run the following command:
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <policy-namespace> --clusterrole=admin --user=<username>
----

* To view a policy in a managed cluster:

** Create a cluster role binding to `open-cluster-management:admin:` cluster role and bind it to the `view` role with the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:view:<cluster-name> --user=<username>
----

[#observability-RBAC]
=== Observability RBAC

To view the observability metrics for a managed cluster, you must have `view` access to that managed cluster on the hub cluster. View the following list of observability features:

* Access managed cluster metrics.
+
Users are denied access to managed cluster metrics, if they are not assigned to the `view` role for the managed cluster on the hub cluster.
* Search for resources.

To view observability data in Grafana, you must have a `RoleBinding` resource in the same namespace of the managed cluster. View the following `RoleBinding` example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
 name: <replace-with-name-of-rolebinding>
 namespace: <replace-with-name-of-managedcluster-namespace>
subjects:
 - kind: <replace with User|Group|ServiceAccount>
   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   name: <replace with name of User|Group|ServiceAccount>
roleRef:
 apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
 kind: ClusterRole
 name: view
----

See link:../governance/rolebinding_policy.adoc#role-binding-policy[Role binding policy] for more information. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#customizing-observability[Customizing observability] to configure observability.

To manage components of observability, view the following API RBAC table:
