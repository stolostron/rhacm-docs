[#role-based-access-control]
= Role-based access control

{product-title} supports role-based access control (RBAC). Your role determines the actions that you can perform. RBAC is based on the authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes, similar to {ocp}. For more information about RBAC, see the OpenShift _RBAC_ overview in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/access_control/using-rbac.html[{ocp-short} documentation].

*Note*: Action buttons are disabled from the console if the user-role access is impermissible.

View the following sections for details of supported RBAC by component:

[#overview-of-roles]
== Overview of roles

Some product resources are cluster-wide and some are namespace-scoped. You must apply cluster role bindings and namespace role bindings to your users for consistent access controls. View the table list of the following role definitions that are supported in {product-title}:

.Role definition table
|===
| Role | Definition

| *cluster-admin*
| A user with cluster-wide binding to the `cluster-admin` role is an {ocp-short} super user, who has all access.

| *open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin*
| A user with cluster-wide binding to the `cluster-manager-admin` role is a {product-title} super user, who has all access. This role allows the user to create a ManagedCluster resource.

| *open-cluster-management:managed-cluster-x (admin)*
| A user with cluster binding to the `managed-cluster-x` role has administrator access to `managedcluster “X”` resource.

| *open-cluster-management:managed-cluster-x (viewer)*
| A user with cluster-wide binding to the `managed-cluster-x` role has view access to `managedcluster “X”` resource.

| *open-cluster-management:subscription-admin*
| A user with the `subscription-admin` role can create Git subscriptions that deploy resources to multiple namespaces. The resources are specified in Kubernetes resource YAML files in the subscribed Git repository. *Note*: When a non-subscription-admin user creates a subscription, all resources are deployed into the subscription namespace regardless of specified namespaces in the resources. For more information, see the <<application-lifecycle-RBAC,Application lifecycle RBAC>> section.

| *admin, edit, view*
| Admin, edit, and view are {ocp-short} default roles. A user with a namespace-scoped binding to these roles has access to `open-cluster-management` resources in a specific namespace, while cluster-wide binding to the same roles gives access to all of the `open-cluster-management` resources cluster-wide.
|===

*Important*:

* Any user can create projects from {ocp-short}, which gives administrator role permissions for the namespace.

* If a user does not have role access to a cluster, the cluster name is not visible. The cluster name is displayed with the following symbol: `-`.

[#rbac-implementation]
== RBAC implementation

RBAC is validated at the console level and at the API level. Actions in the console can be enabled or disabled based on user access role permissions. View the following sections for more information on RBAC for specific lifecycles in the product.

[#cluster-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Cluster lifecycle RBAC

View the following cluster lifecycle RBAC operations.

To create and administer all managed clusters:

* Create a cluster role binding to the cluster role `open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin`. This role is a super user, which has access to all resources and actions. This role allows you to create cluster-scoped `managedcluster` resources, the namespace for the resources that manage the managed cluster, and the resources in the namespace. This role also allows access to provider connections and to bare metal assets that are used to create managed clusters.
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin
----

To administer a managed cluster named `cluster-name`:

* Create a cluster role binding to the cluster role `open-cluster-management:admin:<cluster-name>`. This role allows read/write access to the cluster-scoped `managedcluster` resource. This is needed because the `managedcluster` is a cluster-scoped resource and not a namespace-scoped resource.
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding (role-binding-name) --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:admin:<cluster-name>
----

* Create a namespace role binding to the cluster role `admin`. This role allows read/write access to the resources in the namespace of the managed cluster.
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <cluster-name> --clusterrole=admin
----

To view a managed cluster named `cluster-name`:

* Create a cluster role binding to the cluster role `open-cluster-management:view:<cluster-name>`. This role allows read access to the cluster-scoped `managedcluster` resource. This is needed because the `managedcluster` is a cluster-scoped resource and not a namespace-scoped resource.
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:view:<cluster-name>
----

* Create a namespace role binding to the cluster role `view`. This role allows read-only access to the resources in the namespace of the managed cluster.
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <cluster-name> --clusterrole=view

[#application-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Application lifecycle RBAC

When you create an application, the `_subscription_` namespace is created and the configuration map is created in the `_subscription_` namespace. You must also have access to the `_channel_` namespace. When you want to apply a subscription, you must be a subscription administrator. For more information on managing applications, see link:../applications/managing_subscriptions.adoc#creating-and-managing-subscriptions[Creating and managing subscriptions].

To perform application lifecycle tasks, users with the `admin` role must have access to the `_application_` namespace where the application is created, and to the `_managed cluster_` namespace. For example, the required access to create applications in namespace "N" is a namespace-scoped binding to the `admin` role for namespace "N".

[#governance-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Governance lifecycle RBAC

To perform governance lifecycle operations, users must have access to the namespace where the policy is created, along with access to the `managedcluster` namespace where the policy is applied.

View the following examples:

* To view policies in namespace "N" the following role is required:

  ** A namespace-scoped binding to the `view` role for namespace "N".

* To create a policy in namespace "N" and apply it on `managedcluster` "X", the following roles are required:

  ** A namespace-scoped binding to the `admin` role for namespace "N".
  ** A namespace-scoped binding to the `admin` role for namespace "X".
