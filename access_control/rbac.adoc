[#role-based-access-control]
= Role-based access control

{product-title} supports role-based access control (RBAC). Your role determines the actions that you can perform. RBAC is based on the authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes, similar to {ocp}. For more information about RBAC, see the OpenShift _RBAC_ overview in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/authentication/using-rbac.html[{ocp-short} documentation].

*Note*: Action buttons are disabled from the console if the user-role access is impermissible.

View the following sections for details of supported RBAC by component:

[#overview-of-roles]
== Overview of roles

Some product resources are cluster-wide and some are namespace-scoped. You must apply cluster role bindings and namespace role bindings to your users for consistent access controls. View the table list of the following role definitions that are supported in {product-title}:

.Role definition table
|===
| Role | Definition
| *cluster-admin*
| This is an {ocp-short} default role. A user with cluster binding to the `cluster-admin` role is an {ocp-short} super user, who has all access. 
| *open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin*
| A user with cluster binding to the `open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin` role is a {product-title} super user, who has all access. This role allows the user to create a `ManagedCluster` resource.

//might not have provision role, but there might be self-provision where the user can create any project and objects in the project (Jian will double check and confirm), cluster-wide ability to manage clusters
//add provision cluster role
//| *open-cluster-management:cluster-provisoner*
//| A user with cluster 

//add roles for machine clusterpools, kubernetes admin and view roles (no new roles should be added tho)
//is a ns role required? when a user is bound to a role, cluster role bindings are created in the cluster ns (James-only using clusterset?) , it'll bind to admin
//and view in a specific namespace. Clusterset is a "beta feature" featured flags that would need to be enabled

| *open-cluster-management:admin:<managed_cluster_name>*
| A user with cluster binding to the `open-cluster-management:admin:<managed_cluster_name>` role has administrator access to the `ManagedCluster` resource named,  `<managed_cluster_name>`. When a user has a managed cluster, this role is automatically created.

| *open-cluster-management:view:<managed_cluster_name>*
| A user with cluster binding to the `open-cluster-management:view:<managed_cluster_name>` role has view access to the `ManagedCluster` resource named,  `<managed_cluster_name>`.

| *open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:admin:<managed_clusterset_name>*
| A user with cluster binding to the `open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:admin:<managed_clusterset_name>` role has administrator access to `ManagedCluster` resource named `<managed_clusterset_name>`. The user also has administrator access to `managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, `clusterclaim.hive.openshift.io`, `clusterdeployment.hive.openshift.io`, and `clusterpool.hive.openshift.io` resources, which has the managed cluster set labels: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io` and `clusterset=<managed_clusterset_name>`. A role binding is automatically generated when you are using a cluster set. See link:../clusters/managedclustersets.adoc#managedclustersets[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets] to learn how to manage the resource.

| *open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:view:<managed_clusterset_name>*
| A user with cluster binding to the `open-cluster-management:managedclusterset:view:<managed_clusterset_name>` role has view access to the `ManagedCluster` resource named, <managed_clusterset_name>`. The user also has view access to `managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, `clusterclaim.hive.openshift.io`, `clusterdeployment.hive.openshift.io`, and `clusterpool.hive.openshift.io` resources, which has the managed cluster set labels: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, `clusterset=<managed_clusterset_name>`. For more details on how to manage managed cluster set resources, see link:../clusters/managedclustersets.adoc#managedclustersets[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets].

| *open-cluster-management:subscription-admin*
| A user with the `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` role can create Git subscriptions that deploy resources to multiple namespaces. The resources are specified in Kubernetes resource YAML files in the subscribed Git repository. *Note*: When a non-subscription-admin user creates a subscription, all resources are deployed into the subscription namespace regardless of specified namespaces in the resources. For more information, see the <<application-lifecycle-RBAC,Application lifecycle RBAC>> section.

| *admin, edit, view*
| Admin, edit, and view are {ocp-short} default roles. A user with a namespace-scoped binding to these roles has access to `open-cluster-management` resources in a specific namespace, while cluster-wide binding to the same roles gives access to all of the `open-cluster-management` resources cluster-wide.
|===

*Important*:

* Any user can create projects from {ocp-short}, which gives administrator role permissions for the namespace.

* If a user does not have role access to a cluster, the cluster name is not visible. The cluster name is displayed with the following symbol: `-`.

[#rbac-implementation]
== RBAC implementation

//what are the recommended roles for each pillar in ACM? who can access secrets (credentials and provider connections),
//which roles can delete and manage a cluster [provide access for other users to manage a cluster] Can you see secrets within a ns w/Kubernetes
//replace content in the permissions table with content from previously asked questions
//add a section on WHO can create clusters, show oc commands to complete the tasks presented. Similar format to the cluster lifecycle section; adding instructions onto respective page


RBAC is validated at the console level and at the API level. Actions in the console can be enabled or disabled based on user access role permissions. View the following sections for more information on RBAC for specific lifecycles in the product.

[#cluster-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Cluster lifecycle RBAC

View the following cluster lifecycle RBAC operations.

* To create and administer all managed clusters:

** Create a cluster role binding to the cluster role `open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin
----
+
This role is a super user, which has access to all resources and actions. You can create cluster-scoped `managedcluster` resources, the namespace for the resources that manage the managed cluster, and the resources in the namespace with this role. You can also access provider connections and bare metal assets that are used to create managed clusters with this role.


* To administer a managed cluster named `cluster-name`:

** Create a cluster role binding to the cluster role `open-cluster-management:admin:<cluster-name>` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding (role-binding-name) --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:admin:<cluster-name>
----
+
This role has read and write access to the cluster-scoped `managedcluster` resource. This is needed because the `managedcluster` is a cluster-scoped resource and not a namespace-scoped resource.

** Create a namespace role binding to the cluster role `admin` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <cluster-name> --clusterrole=admin
----
+
This role has read and write access to the resources in the namespace of the managed cluster.


* To view a managed cluster named `cluster-name`:

** Create a cluster role binding to the cluster role `open-cluster-management:view:<cluster-name>` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:view:<cluster-name>
----
+
This role has read access to the cluster-scoped `managedcluster` resource. This is needed because the `managedcluster` is a cluster-scoped resource and not a namespace-scoped resource.


** Create a namespace role binding to the cluster role `view` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <cluster-name> --clusterrole=view
----
+
This role has read-only access to the resources in the namespace of the managed cluster.

* View a list of the managed clusters that you can access by entering the following command:
+
----
oc get managedclusters.clusterview.open-cluster-management.io
----
+
This command is used by administrators and users without cluster administrator privileges.

* View a list of the managed cluster sets that you can access by entering the following command:
+
----
oc get managedclustersets.clusterview.open-cluster-management.io
----
+
This command is used by administrators and users without cluster administrator privileges.

[#cluster-pools-rbac]
==== Cluster pools RBAC

View the following cluster pool RBAC operations.

* To use cluster pool provision clusters:

** As a cluster administrator, create a managed cluster set and grant administrator permission to roles by adding the role to the group.
*** Grant `admin` permission to the `server-foundation-clusterset` managed cluster set with the following command:
+
----
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group open-cluster-management:clusterset-admin:server-foundation-clusterset 
server-foundation-team-admin
----

*** Grant `view` permission to the `server-foundation-clusterset` managed cluster set with the following command:
+
----
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group open-cluster-management:clusterset-view:server-foundation-clusterset server-foundation-team-user
----

** Create a namespace for the cluster pool, `server-foundation-clusterpool`.

*** Grant `admin` permission to `server-foundation-clusterpool` for the `server-foundation-team-admin` by running the following commands:
+
----
oc adm new-project server-foundation-clusterpool

oc adm policy add-role-to-group admin server-foundation-team-admin --namespace  server-foundation-clusterpool
----

** As a team administrator, create a cluster pool named `ocp46-aws-clusterpool` with a cluster set label, `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=server-foundation-clusterset` in the cluster pool namespace. 

*** The `server-foundation-webhook` checks if the cluster pool has the cluster set label, and if the user has permission to create cluster pools in the cluster set.

*** The `server-foundation-controller` grants `view` permission to the `server-foundation-clusterpool` namespace for `server-foundation-team-user`.

** When a cluster pool is created, the cluster pool creates a `clusterdeployment`.

*** The `server-foundation-controller` grants `admin` permission to the `clusterdeployment` namespace for `server-foundation-team-admin`.

*** The `server-foundation-controller` grants `view` permission `clusterdeployment` namespace for `server-foundation-team-user`.
+
*Note*: As a `team-admin` and `team-user`, you have `admin` permission to the `clusterpool`, `clusterdeplyment`, and `clusterclaim`.

[#credentials-role-based-access-control]
=== Credentials role-based access control

The access to credentials is controlled by Kubernetes. Credentials are stored and secured as Kubernetes secrets. The following permissions apply to accessing secrets in {product-title}:

* Users with access to create secrets in a namespace can create credentials.
* Users with access to read secrets in a namespace can also view credentials.
* Users with the Kubernetes cluster roles of `admin` and `edit` can create and edit secrets.
* Users with the Kubernetes cluster role of `view` cannot view secrets because reading the contents of secrets enables access to service account credentials.

[#application-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Application lifecycle RBAC

When you create an application, the `_subscription_` namespace is created and the configuration map is created in the `_subscription_` namespace. You must also have access to the `_channel_` namespace. When you want to apply a subscription, you must be a subscription administrator. For more information on managing applications, see link:../applications/allow_deny.adoc#creating-allow-deny-list[Creating an allow and deny list as subscription administrator]. 

View the following application lifecycle RBAC operations:

* To create and administer application on all managed clusters with a user named `username`:

** Create a cluster role binding to the `open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin` cluster role and bind it to `username`, run the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:cluster-manager-admin --user=<username>
----
+
This role is a super user, which has access to all resources and actions. You can create the namespace for the application and all application resources in the namespace with this role.

* *Option*: You can create applications that deploy resources to multiple namespaces:

** Create a cluster role binding to the `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` cluster role, and bind it to a user named `username`. Run the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:subscription-admin --user=<username>
----

* To create and administer an application named `application-name` in the `cluster-name` managed cluster, with `username` user:

** Create a cluster role binding to the `open-cluster-management:admin:` cluster role and bind it to `username` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:admin:<cluster-name> --user=<username>
----
+
This role has read and write access to all `application` resources on the managed cluster, `cluster-name`. Repeat this if access for other managed clusters is required.

** Create a namespace role binding to the `application` namespace using the `admin` role and bind it to `username` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <application-namespace> --clusterrole=admin --user=<username>
----
+
This role has read and write access to all `application` resources in the `application` namspace. Repeat this if access for other applications is required or if the application deploys to multiple namespaces.

* *Option*: You can create applications that deploy resources to multiple namespaces:

** Create a cluster role binding to the open-cluster-management:subscription-admin cluster role and bind it to `username` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:subscription-admin --user=<username>
----

* To view an application on a managed cluster named `cluster-name` with the user named `username`:

** Create a cluster role binding to the `open-cluster-management:view:` cluster role  and bind it to `username` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:view:<cluster-name> --user=<username>
----
+
This role has read access to all `application` resources on the managed cluster, `cluster-name`. Repeat this if access for other managed clusters is required.

** Create a namespace role binding to the `application` namespace using the `view` role and bind it to `username`. Enter the following command:
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <application-namespace> --clusterrole=view --user=<username>
----
+
This role has read access to all `application` resources in the `application` namspace. Repeat this if access for other applications is required.

[#governance-lifecycle-RBAC]
=== Governance lifecycle RBAC

When a policy is created, the policy is created in the cluster. Roles for the governance lifecycle are namespace-scoped. A user must also have access to the managed cluster. 

To perform governance lifecycle operations, users must have access to the namespace where the policy is created, along with access to the managed cluster where the policy is applied.

View the following examples:

* To create a policy in the `policy` namespace and apply it in a managed cluster named `cluster-name`:

** Create a namespace role binding to the `policy` namespace using the `open-cluster-management:admin:` role. Run the following command:
+
----
oc create rolebinding <role-binding-name> -n <policy-namespace> --clusterrole=admin --user=<username>
----

* To view a policy in a managed cluster:

** Create a cluster role binding to `open-cluster-management:admin:` cluster role and bind it to the `view` role with the following command:
+
----
oc create clusterrolebinding <role-binding-name> --clusterrole=open-cluster-management:view:<cluster-name> --user=<username>

[#observability-RBAC]
=== Observability RBAC

To view the observability metrics for a managed cluster, you must have `view` access to that managed cluster on the hub cluster. View the following list of observability features:

* Access managed cluster metrics.
+
Users are denied access to managed cluster metrics, if they are not assigned to the `view` role for the managed cluster on the hub cluster.
* Search for resources.

To view observability data in Grafana, you must have a `RoleBinding` resource in the same namespace of the managed cluster. View the following `RoleBinding` example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
