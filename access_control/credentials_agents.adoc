= Rotating credentials for agents

Agents are responsible for connections. See how you can rotate the following credentials:

 - `registration-agent`: Connects the registration agent to the hub cluster.
 - `work-agent`: Connects the work agent to the hub cluster.
 
+ 
To rotate credentials, delete the `hub-kubeconfig` secret to restart the registration pods.
 
 - `APIServer`: Connects agents and add-ons to the hub cluster.
 
+
. On the hub cluster, display the import command by entering the following command: 

+
----
oc get secret -n ${CLUSTER_NAME} ${CLUSTER_NAME}-import -ojsonpath='{.data.import\.yaml}' | base64 --decode  > import.yaml
----

+
. On the managed cluster, apply the `import.yaml` file. Run the following command: `oc apply -f import.yaml`.
