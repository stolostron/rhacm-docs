User-facing content is user-visible text that is contained within a software program and is integral to the execution of that program. This applies to all software, whether it is operating system, middleware, or application software.

In this context, "contained within" means accessible only by running the software, and "integral to execution" means essential to the execution of the software. Traditionally, this has meant messages, contextual help, and extended help information. The introduction of new human-computer interaction technologies broadens this to include concepts such as intelligent agents, coaches, and wizards. The primary goal of such concepts is to guide users through complex tasks rather than to educate or inform.

## Where?

Used throughout our User Interface (UI) and products for embedded assistance and progressive disclosure, such as 

- Labels and alt text for UI controls
- Tooltips
- Error messages
- Inline text in UI
- Descriptive text in UI
- Chat Bots
- Command Line Interface
- Control-level assistance (tooltips)
- Hover help or pop-up help (infopops)
- Context-sensitive help
- Messages (error, information, other)
- Panel-level assistance or additional control level assistance linked from the UI
- Cross-panel-level or user task-based assistance linked from the UI
- Where the content of the task helps to drive the user through the UI
- Extended help
- Wizards
- Intelligent agents
- Mnemonics or accelerators
- Hot keys
- IPLA family of software license agreements
- Terms of Use
- Service Delivery contracts (SD)

## Reason for doc input on 

- Doc reviews all new UI content, such labels, tooltips, error messages, and other UI text (writers please make sure this is consistent across pillars)
- Doc reviews with IBM/Pattern Fly/RH style, terminology, existing docs, and progressive disclosure in mind
- Focus on consistency across all product documentation and other products including the following documentation sources:
  - UI text 
  - Portal
  - Blogs 
  - Other (presentations, readmes, release notes)
- Structure text for translation and accessibility
- Identify errors and potential issues early to avoid client issues and late UI changes
- Provide assistance to design and development with writing UI text
- Provide feedback on related user flows to improve and simplify UI and text

## Process to get user-facing content reviewed

For general clean-up, a GitHub issue is needed for the doc team.

- Dev can create your PR and assign writer as reviewer, confident writer can also make a change to dev source if devs agree
- Additionally, you can provide the link to your properties files and request that the writer edit the file for you in his or her own branch/PR

## Error Messages

Ensure that you follow these guidelines to avoid poor error messages: 

- Poorly written and incomplete messages are costly:

- Poor messages cause customers to call Support, which can cost thousands, if not tens of thousands, of dollars.
For many products, the top searches on information centers or other search engines are for messages: Customers are looking for more information to help them resolve the problem. In many cases, the message that was shown in the interface was not helpful.
Regularly review information center search statistics to determine whether users are looking for specific messages. There could be problems with those messages.

- Poor messages reflect badly on products. Consumable software and hardware products require that all parts of the product, including user interface (UI) text, embedded assistance, information center and help topics, and messages are clear, accurate, complete, and helpful.
