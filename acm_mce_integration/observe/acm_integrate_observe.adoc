== Observing hosted control planes

After you enable the `multicluster-observability` pod, you can use {acm-short} Observability Grafana dashboards to view the following information about your hosted control planes:

- *ACM* > *Hosted Control Planes Overview* dashboard to see cluster capacity estimates for hosting hosted control planes, the related cluster resources, and the list and status of existing hosted control planes. For more information, see: link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/hosted_control_planes/hosted-control-planes-overview#hosted-control-planes-overview_hcp-overview[Introduction to hosted control planes]. 

- *ACM* > *Resources* > *Hosted Control Plane* dashboard that you can access from the _Overview_ page to see the resource utilization of the selected hosted control plane. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/hosted_control_planes/preparing-to-deploy-hosted-control-planes#installing-the-hosted-control-plane-command-line-interface[Installing the hosted control planes command-lin interface].
