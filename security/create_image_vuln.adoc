[#managing-image-vulnerability-policies]
= Managing image vulnerability policies

Configuration policy controller monitors the status of image vulnerability policies.
Image vulnerability policies are applied to check if your containers have vulnerabilities.
Learn to create, apply, view, and update your image vulnerability policy.

[#creating-an-image-vulnerability-policy]
== Creating an image vulnerability policy

You can create a YAML for your image vulnerability policy from the command line interface (CLI) or from the console.
View the following sections to create an image vulnerability policy:

[#creating-an-image-vulnerability-policy-from-the-cli]
=== Creating an image vulnerability policy from the CLI

Complete the following steps to create an image vulnerability policy from the CLI:

. Create a YAML file for your image vulnerability policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl create -f imagevulnpolicy-1.yaml
----

. Apply the policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl apply -f <imagevuln-policy-file-name>  --namespace=<namespace>
----

. List and verify the policies by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get imagevulnpolicy --namespace=<namespace>
----

Your image vulnerability policy is created.

[#viewing-your-image-vulnerability-policy-from-the-cli]
==== Viewing your image vulnerability policy from the CLI

Complete the following steps to view your image vulnerability policy from the CLI:

. View details for a specific image vulnerability policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get imagevulnpolicy <policy-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
----

. View a description of your image vulnerability policy by running the following command:

[#creating-an-image-vulnerability-policy-from-the-console]
== Creating an image vulnerability policy from the console

As you create an image vulnerability policy from the console, a YAML file is also created in the YAML editor.
Complete the following steps to create the image vulnerability policy from the console:

. Log in to your cluster from the console.
. From the navigation menu, click *Governance and risk*.
. Click *Create policy*.
. Select *ImageManifestVulnPolicy* from the _Specifications_ field.
Parameter values are automatically set.
You can edit your values.
. Click *Create*.

An image vulnerability policy is created.

[#viewing-image-vulnerability-violations-from-the-console]
== Viewing image vulnerability violations from the console

. From the navigation menu, click *Govern risk* to view a table list of your policies.
. Select the *`policy-imagemanifestvulnpolicy`* policy > *_Violations_ tab* to view the cluster location of the violation.
+
Your image vulnerability violation might resemble the following:
+
----
imagemanifestvulns exist and should be deleted: [sha256.7ac7819e1523911399b798309025935a9968b277d86d50e5255465d6592c0266] in namespace default; [sha256.4109631e69d1d562f014dd49d5166f1c18b4093f4f311275236b94b21c0041c0] in namespace calamari; [sha256.573e9e0a1198da4e29eb9a8d7757f7afb7ad085b0771bc6aa03ef96dedc5b743, sha256.a56d40244a544693ae18178a0be8af76602b89abe146a43613eaeac84a27494e, sha256.b25126b194016e84c04a64a0ad5094a90555d70b4761d38525e4aed21d372820] in namespace open-cluster-management-agent-addon; [sha256.64320fbf95d968fc6b9863581a92d373bc75f563a13ae1c727af37450579f61a] in namespace openshift-cluster-version
----

. Navigate to your {ocp-short} console by selecting the _Cluster_ link.
. From the navigation menu on the {ocp-short} console, click *Administration* > *Custom Resource Definitions*.
. Select *`imagemanifestvulns`* > *_Instances_ tab* to view all of the `imagemanifestvulns` instances.
. Select an entry to view more details.

[#updating-image-vulnerability-policies]
== Updating image vulnerability policies

Learn to update image vulnerability policies by viewing the following section.

[#disabling-image-vulnerability-policies]
=== Disabling image vulnerability policies

Complete the following steps to disable your image vulnerability policy:

. Log in to your {product-title} console.
. From the navigation menu, click *Govern risk* to view a table list of your policies.
. Disable your policy by clicking the *Options* icon > *Disable*.
The _Disable Policy_ dialog box appears.
. Click *Disable policy*.

Your policy is disabled.

[#deleting-an-image-vulnerability-policy]
=== Deleting an image vulnerability policy

Delete the image vulnerability policy from the CLI or the console.

* Delete an image vulnerability policy from the CLI:
 .. Delete a certificate policy by running the following command:
// verify command `namespace`
+
----
 kubectl delete policy <imagevulnpolicy-name> -n <mcm namespace>
----
+
After your policy is deleted, it is removed from your target cluster or clusters.

 .. Verify that your policy is removed by running the following command:
+
----
 kubectl get policy <imagevulnpolicy-name> -n <mcm namespace>
----
* Delete an image vulnerability policy from the console:
 .. From the navigation menu, click *Govern risk* to view a table list of your policies.
 .. Click the *Options* icon for the policy you want to delete in the policy violation table.
 .. Click *Remove*.
 .. From the _Remove policy_ dialog box, click *Remove policy*.

Your image vulnerability policy is deleted.
