[#certificate-policy-controller]
= Certificate policy controller

Certificate policy controller can be used to detect certificates that are close to expiring, and detect time durations (hours) that are too long or contain DNS names that fail to match specified patterns.

Configure and customize the certificate policy controller by updating the following parameters in your controller policy: 
 
- `minimumCADuration`
- `maximumDuration`
- `maximumCADuration`
- `allowedSANPattern`
- `disallowedSANPattern`

Your policy might become non-compliant due to either of the following scenarios:

* When a certificate expires in less than the minimum duration of time or exceeds the maximum time.
* When DNS names fail to match the specified pattern.

The certificate policy controller is created on your managed cluster. The controller communicates with the local Kubernetes API server to get the list of secrets that contain certificates and determine all non-compliant certificates.
For more information about CRDs, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[Extend the Kubernetes API with CustomResourceDefinitions].

Certificate policy controller does not support the `enforce` feature.

[#certificate-policy-controller-yaml-table]
=== Certificate policy controller YAML table

.Parameter table
|===
| Field | Description

| apiVersion
| Required.
Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| kind
| Required.
Set the value to `CertificatePolicy` to indicate the type of policy.

| metadata.name
| Required.
The name to identify the policy.

| netadata.namespace
| Required.
The namespaces within the managed cluster where the policy is created.

| metadata.labels
| Optional.
In a certificate policy, the `category=system-and-information-integrity` label categorizes the policy and facilitates querying the certificate policies.
If there is a different value for the `category` key in your certificate policy, the value is overridden by the certificate controller.

| spec
| Required.
Specifications of which certificates to monitor and refresh.

| spec.namespaceSelector
| Required.
Managed cluster namespace to which you want to apply the policy.
Enter parameter values for `Include` and `Exclude`.
*Notes*: 

&#8226; When you create multiple certificate policies and apply them to the same managed cluster, each policy `namespaceSelector` must be assigned a different value.

&#8226; If the `namespaceSelector` for the certificate policy controller does not match any namespace, the policy is considered compliant.

| spec.remediationAction
| Required.
Specifies the remediation of your policy.
Set the parameter value to `inform`.
Certificate policy controller only supports `inform` feature.

| spec.severity
| Required. Informs the user of the severity when the policy is non-compliant. Use the following parameter values: `low`, `medium`, or `high`.

| spec.minimumDuration
| Required. When a value is not specified, the default value is `100h`. This parameter specifies the smallest duration (in hours) before a certificate is considered non-compliant. The parameter value uses the time duration format from Golang. See link:https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration[Golang Parse Duration] for more information.

| spec.minimumCADuration
| Optional. Set a value to identify signed certificates that might expire soon with a different value from other certificates. If the parameter value is not specified, the CA certificate expiration is the value used for the `minimumDuration`. See link:https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration[Golang Parse Duration] for more information.

| spec.maximumDuration
| Optional. Set a value to identify certificates that have been created with a duration that exceeds your desired limit. The parameter uses the time duration format from Golang. See link:https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration[Golang Parse Duration] for more information.

| spec.maximumCADuration
| Optional. Set a value to identify signed certificates that have been created with a duration that exceeds your defined limit. The parameter uses the time duration format from Golang. See link:https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration[Golang Parse Duration] for more information.

| spec.allowedSANPattern
| Optional. A regular expression that must match every SAN entry that you have defined in your certificates. This parameter checks DNS names against patterns. See the https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/[Golang Regular Expression syntax] for more information.

| spec.disallowedSANPattern
| Optional. A regular expression that must not match any SAN entries you have defined in your certificates. This parameter checks DNS names against patterns. See the https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/[Golang Regular Expression syntax] for more information.

[#certificate-policy-sample]
== Certificate policy sample

When your certificate policy controller is created on your hub cluster, a replicated policy is created on your managed cluster.
Your certificate policy on your managed cluster might resemble the following file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: CertificatePolicy
metadata:
  name: certificate-policy-1
  namespace: kube-system
  label:
    category: "System-Integrity"
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    include: ["default", "kube-*"]
    exclude: ["kube-system"]
  remediationAction: inform
  minimumDuration: 100h
  minimumCADuration: 200h
  maximumDuration: 2161h
  maximumCADuration: 43920h
  allowedSANPattern: "[[:alpha:]]"
  disallowedSANPattern: "[\\*]"
