As you create an E8 scan policy from the console, a YAML file is also created in the YAML editor. 
*Note:* The compliance operator must be installed. For more details, see xref:../security/create_compliance_operator.adoc#creating-a-compliance-operator-policy-from-the-console[Creating a compliance operator policy from the console]. 

Complete the following steps to create a E8 scan policy from the console:

. Log in to your hub cluster.

Copy and paste the https://github.com/open-cluster-management/policy-collection/blob/master/stable/CM-Configuration-Management/policy-compliance-operator-e8-scan.yaml[`policy-e8-scan`] from the policy-collection repository.
+ 
The following resources are created: ScanSettingBinding (`_ScanSettingBinding_`), a ComplianceSuite (`_compliance-suite-e8_`), and a ComplianceCheckResult (`_compliance-suite-e8-results_`).
+
*Note:* Automatic remediation is supported. Set the remediation action to `enforce` to create ScanSettingBinding resource. 

An E8 scan policy is created.
