[#sizing-your-cluster]
= Sizing your cluster

Each {product-title} cluster is unique and the following guidelines provide sample deployment sizes for you. Recommendations are classified by size and purpose. {product-title-short} applies the following three dimensions for sizing and placement of supporting services:

* Availability Zones, which isolate potential fault domains across the cluster. Typical clusters should have nearly equivalent worker node capacity in three or more availability zones. 

* vCPU reservations and limits, which establish vCPU capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. A vCPU is equivalent to a Kubernetes compute unit. For more information, see Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-cpu[Meaning of CPU].

* Memory reservations and limits. which establish memory capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. Reservations establish a _lower_ bound of CPU or memory, and limits establish an _upper_ bound.

* Persistent data, which is managed by the product and stored in the etcd cluster that is used by Kubernetes. *Best practice:* For {ocp-short}, distribute the master nodes of the cluster across three (3) availability zones.

[#product-environment]
== Product environment

**Note:** The following requirements are _not_ minimum requirements.

|===
|{ocp-short} node role|Availability zones|Data stores|Total reserved memory (_lower_ bound)|Total reserved CPU (_lower_ bound)

|Master|3|etcd x 3|Per {ocp-short} sizing guidelines|Per OpenShift sizing guidelines

|Worker|3|redisgraph/redis x 1|12 GB|6 CPU
|===

In addition to {product-title-short}, the {ocp-short} cluster runs additional services to support cluster features. The following node sizes (3 nodes of the types noted in the information that follows, distributed evenly across 3 availability zones) are recommended.

IBM Power systems provide the ability to configure simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which extends the number of vCPUs that can run on each core. If you configured SMT, your SMT level determines how you satisfy the 16 vCPU requirement. The most common configurations are:
+
*** Two cores running on SMT-8 (the default configuration for systems that are running IBM PowerVM) provides the required 16 vCPUs.
*** Four cores running on SMT-4 provides the required 16 vCPUs. 
+
For more information about SMT, see https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=concepts-simultaneous-multithreading[Simultaneous multithreading].
