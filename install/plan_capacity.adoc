[#sizing-your-cluster]
= Sizing your cluster

Each {product-title} cluster is unique and the following guidelines provide sample deployment sizes for you. Recommendations are classified by size and purpose. {product-title-short} applies the following three dimensions for sizing and placement of supporting services:

* Availability Zones, which isolate potential fault domains across the cluster. Typical clusters should have nearly equivalent worker node capacity in three or more availability zones. 

* vCPU reservations and limits, which establish vCPU capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. A vCPU is equivalent to a Kubernetes compute unit. For more information, see Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-cpu[Meaning of CPU].

* Memory reservations and limits. which establish memory capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. Reservations establish a _lower_ bound of CPU or memory, and limits establish an _upper_ bound.

* Persistent data, which is managed by the product and stored in the etcd cluster that is used by Kubernetes. *Best practice:* For {ocp-short}, distribute the master nodes of the cluster across three (3) availability zones.

== Product environment

**Note:** The following requirements are _not_ minimum requirements.

|===
|{ocp-short} node role|Availability zones|Data stores|Total reserved memory (_lower_ bound)|Total reserved CPU (_lower_ bound)

|Master|3|etcd x 3|Per {ocp-short} sizing guidelines|Per OpenShift sizing guidelines

|Worker|3|redisgraph/redis x 1|12 GB|6 CPU

In addition to {product-title-short}, the {ocp-short} cluster runs additional services to support cluster features. The following node sizes (3 nodes of the types noted in the information that follows, distributed evenly across 3 availability zones) are recommended.

[#example-1k-sno]
=== Example scenario: Creating and managing 1000 single node OpenShift clusters

The following table shows the minimum requirements for using {product-title-short} to provision 1000 single node OpenShift (SNO) clusters (230 and more provisioned at the same time), and manage those 1000 SNO clusters with a hub cluster:

|===
|{ocp-short} node role|Node count|Required persistent volumes (PVs)|Utilized memory|Utilized CPU

|Master|3|Assisted installer - 110 Gb for each of the three nodes, PostgreSQL - 25 Gb for each of the three nodes, etcd for each of the three nodes. *Note:* The `etcd` daemon must be on NVMe storage. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/scalability_and_performance/recommended-host-practices.html[Recommended host practices] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information.|30 GB|10 CPU
|Worker|3|Observability - 25 Gb for each node, object stored - User supplied, search was disabled. Redisgraph is not required.|44 GB|17 CPU

IBM Z systems provide the ability to configure simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which extends the number of vCPUs that can run on each core. If you configured SMT, One physical core (IFL) provides two logical cores (threads). The hypervisor can provide two or more vCPUs.
+
One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.

IBM Power systems provide the ability to configure simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which extends the number of vCPUs that can run on each core. If you configured SMT, your SMT level determines how you satisfy the 16 vCPU requirement. The most common configurations are:
+
*** Two cores running on SMT-8 (the default configuration for systems that are running IBM PowerVM) provides the required 16 vCPUs.
*** Four cores running on SMT-4 provides the required 16 vCPUs. 
+
