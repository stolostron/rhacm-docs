= Installing and upgrading

Install {acm} through {olm}, which manages the installation, upgrade, and removal of the components that encompass the {acm-short} hub cluster. Because {acm-short} depends on and uses the {mce-short}, after you create the `MultiClusterHub` resource during installation, the {acm-short} operator automatically installs the {mce-short} operator and creates the `MultiClusterEngine` resource. 

You must have a supported version of {ocp-short} to install {acm-short}. 

Before you install, review the required hardware and system configuration for each product. You can install online on Linux with a supported version of {ocp}. 

For full support information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7086905[{acm-short} Support Matrix] and the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/advanced-cluster-management[Lifecycle and update policies for {acm}].

*Deprecated:* {acm-short} 2.7 and earlier versions are no longer supported. The documentation might remain available, but without any Errata or other updates.

*Best practice:* Upgrade to the most recent version.

*FIPS notice:* If you do not specify your own ciphers in `spec.ingress.sslCiphers`, then the `multiclusterhub-operator` provides a default list of ciphers. If you upgrade and want FIPS compliance, remove the following two ciphers from the `MultiClusterHub` resource: `ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305` and `ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305`.

The documentation references the earliest supported {ocp-short} version, unless a specific component or function is introduced and tested only on a more recent version of {ocp-short}.

Installing {acm} sets up a multi-node cluster production environment. You can install {acm} in either standard or high-availability configurations.
