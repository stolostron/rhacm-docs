= Installing and upgrading

Before you install, review the required hardware and system configuration for each product. You can install online on Linux with a supported version of {ocp}.

. You must have a supported version of {ocp-short}. For example, you can use Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS, or Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated.

. You must install the {mce}.

FIPS notice: If you do not specify your own ciphers in `spec.ingress.sslCiphers`, then the `multiclusterhub-operator` provides a default list of ciphers. If you upgrade and want FIPS compliance, remove the following two ciphers from the `multiclusterhub` resource: `ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305` and `ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305`.

The documentation references the earliest supported {ocp-short} version, unless a specific component or function is introduced and tested only on a more recent version of {ocp-short}.

For full support information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7073065[Support matrix] and the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/advanced-cluster-management[Lifecycle and update policies for {acm}].

*Deprecated:* {acm-short} 2.7 and earlier versions are no longer supported. The documentation might remain available, but without any Errata or other updates.

*Best practice:* Upgrade to the most recent version.

Installing {acm} sets up a multi-node cluster production environment. You can install {acm} in either standard or high-availability configurations. View the following documentation for more information about the installation procedure:
