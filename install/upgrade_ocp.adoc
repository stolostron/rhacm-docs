= Upgrading {ocp-short}

You can upgrade the version of {ocp} that hosts your {product-title} hub cluster. Back up your data before initiating any cluster-wide upgrade. 

During the upgrade of the {ocp-short} version, the {product-title-short} web console might show brief periods when pages or data are unavailable. Indicators can include HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error), HTTP 504 (Gateway Timeout Error), or errors that data that was previously available is not available. This is a normal part of the upgrade, and no data is lost when this occurs. The availability is eventually restored. 

The search index is also rebuilt during this upgrade, so any queries that are submitted during the upgrade might be incomplete.

The following table contains some noted observations from an upgrade from {ocp-short} version 4.4.3 to 4.4.10:
