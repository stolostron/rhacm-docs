[#confirm-your-red-hat-openshift-container-platform-installation]
== Confirm your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation

* You must have a supported {ocp} version, including the registry and storage services, installed and working in your cluster.
For more information about installing {ocp-short}, see the {ocp-short} documentation.
* For {ocp-short} version 4.7, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/welcome/index.html[{ocp-short} Documentation].
* To ensure that the {ocp-short} cluster is set up correctly, access the {ocp-short} web console.
+
Run the `kubectl -n openshift-console get route` command to access the {ocp-short} web console.
See the following example output:
+
----
  openshift-console          console             console-openshift-console.apps.new-coral.purple-chesterfield.com                       console                  https   reencrypt/Redirect     None
----
+
The console URL in this example is: `https:// console-openshift-console.apps.new-coral.purple-chesterfield.com`.
Open the URL in your browser and check the result.
If the console URL displays `console-openshift-console.router.default.svc.cluster.local`, set the value for `openshift_master_default_subdomain` when you install {ocp-short}.

See xref:../install/plan_capacity.adoc#sizing-your-cluster[Sizing your cluster] to learn about setting up capacity for your hub cluster.
