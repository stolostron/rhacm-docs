[#install-on-disconnected-networks]
= Install in disconnected network environments

You might need to install {product-title} on disconnected {ocp} clusters. To install on a disconnected hub cluster, perform the following steps in addition to the usual install or upgrade steps that are for the connected network environment.

*Required access:* You need _cluster administration_ access for all installation and upgrade tasks.

See the following sections:

* <<disconnect-prerequisites,Prerequisites>>
* <<disconnect-confirm-ocp-installation,Confirm your {ocp-short} installation>>
* <<disconnect-configure-olm,Configure {olm}>> 
* <<disconnect-configure-icsp,Configure image content source policies>>
* <<disconnect-install-op-and-hub,Install the {product-title} operator and hub>>

[#disconnect-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites 

You must meet the following requirements before you install {product-title}:

* Since you are installing in a disconnected network environment, you need access to a local image registry to store mirrored {olm} catalogs and operator images. You probably already set up a local image registry when installing the {ocp-short} cluster in this environment, so you should be able to use the same local image registry.

* You must have a workstation that has access to both the Internet and your local mirror registry. 

* A supported {ocp} version must be deployed in your environment, and you must be logged in with the command line interface (CLI). See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/installing/index[{ocp-short} version 4.11 install documentation] for information on installing {ocp}. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the CLI] for information about installing and configuring `oc` commands with the Red Hat OpenShift CLI.

* Review xref:../install/cluster_size.adoc#sizing-your-cluster[Sizing your cluster] to learn about setting up capacity for your hub cluster.

[#disconnect-confirm-ocp-installation]
== Confirm your {ocp-short} installation

* While you are connected, run the `oc -n openshift-console get route` command to access the {ocp-short} web console. See the following example output:

+
----
openshift-console          console             console-openshift-console.apps.new-coral.purple-chesterfield.com                       console              https   reencrypt/Redirect     None
----

Open the URL in your browser and check the result. If the console URL displays `console-openshift-console.router.default.svc.cluster.local`, set the value for `openshift_master_default_subdomain` when you install {ocp-short}.

== Confirm availability of a local image registry

*Best practice:* Use your existing mirror registry for the {olm} operator related content.

Installing {product-title} in a disconnected environment involves the use of a local mirror image registry. Because you have already completed the installation of the {ocp-short} cluster in your disconnected environment, you already set up a mirror registry for use during the {ocp} cluster installation.

If you do not already have a local image registry, create one by completing the procedure that is described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/installing/disconnected-installation-mirroring#mirroring-images-disconnected-install[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation] of the {ocp} documentation.

[#disconnect-configure-olm]
== Configure {olm}

Because {product-title} is packaged as an operator, installing is completed by using {olm}.

In disconnected environments, {olm} cannot access the standard operator sources that Red Hat provided operators can because they are hosted on image registries that are not accessible from a disconnected cluster. Instead, a cluster administrator can enable the installation and upgrade of operators in a disconnected environment by using mirrored image registries and operator catalogs.

To prepare your disconnected cluster for installing {product-title}, follow the procedure that is described in
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html-single/operators/index#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

[#additional-requirements]
=== Additional requirements 
 
When you complete the previous procedures, note the following requirements that are also specific to {product-title}:

[#disconnect-include-acm-pkgs]
==== Include operator packages in mirror catalog 

* Include the required operator packages in your mirror catalog. Red Hat provides the {product-title} operator in the Red Hat operators catalog, which is delivered by the `registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index` index image. When you prepare your mirror of this catalog index image, you can choose to either mirror the entire catalog as provided by Red Hat, or you can mirror a subset that contains only the operator packages that you intend to use.

+
If you are creating a full mirror catalog, no special considerations are needed as all of the packages required to install {product-title} are included. However, if you are creating a partial or filtered mirrored catalog, for which you identify particular packages to be included, you need to include the following package names in your list:

   - `advanced-cluster-manager`
   - `multicluster-engine`

* Use one of the two mirroring procedures. 

+
* If you are creating the mirrored catalog or registry by using the OPM utility, `opm index prune`, include the following package names in the value of the `-p` option as displayed in the following example, with the current version replacing `4.x`:

+
----
opm index prune \
   -f registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.x \
   -p advanced-cluster-management,multicluster-engine \
   -t myregistry.example.com:5000/mirror/my-operator-index:v4.x
----

+
* If you are populating the mirrored catalog or registry by using the `oc-mirror` plug-in instead, include the following package names in the packages list section of your `ImageSetConfiguration`, as displayed in the following example, with the current version replacing `4.x`:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
storageConfig:
  registry:
     imageURL: myregistry.example.com:5000/mirror/oc-mirror-metadata
mirror:
  platform:
    channels:
    - name: stable-4.x
      type: ocp
  operators:
  - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.11
    packages:
    - name: advanced-cluster-management
    - name: multicluster-engine
  additionalImages: []
  helm: {}
----

[#config-mirror]
==== Configure to use your mirror registry

When you have populated a local mirror registry with the earlier packages that are required for installing {product-title}, complete the steps that are described in the topic link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html-single/operators/index#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks] to make your mirror registry and catalog available on your disconnected cluster, which includes the following steps:

. link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html-single/operators/index#olm-restricted-networks-operatorhub_olm-restricted-networks[Disabling the default OperatorHub sources]
. link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html-single/operators/index#olm-mirror-catalog_olm-restricted-networks[Mirroring the Operator catalog]
. link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html-single/operators/index#olm-creating-catalog-from-index_olm-restricted-networks[Adding a catalog source for your mirrored catalog]

[#note-source-name]
==== Find the catalog source name

As described in the procedures in the {ocp} documentation, you need to add a `CatalogSource` resource to your disconnected cluster. *Important:* Take note of the value of the `metadata.name` field, which you will need later.

Add the `CatalogSource` resource into the `openshift-marketplace` namespace by using a YAML file similar to the following example, replacing `4.x` with the current version:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: my-mirror-catalog-source
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  image: myregistry.example.com:5000/mirror/my-operator-index:v4.x
  sourceType: grpc
----
 
You need the `metadata.name` field value for the annotation in the `MulticlusterHub` resource that you will create later.

[#verify-required-package]
== Verify required packages are available

{olm} polls catalog sources for available packages on a regular timed interval. After {olm} polls the catalog source for your mirrored catalog, you can verify that the required packages are available from on your disconnected cluster by querying the available `PackageManifest` resources.

Run the following command, directed at your disconnected cluster:

----
oc -n openshift-marketplace get packagemanifests 
----

The list that is displayed should include entries showing that the following packages are supplied by 
the catalog source for your mirror catalog:

* `advanced-cluster-manager`
* `multicluster-engine`

[#disconnect-configure-icsp]
== Configure image content source policies

In order to have your cluster obtain container images for the {product-title} operator from your mirror registry, rather than from the internet-hosted registries, you must configure an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` on your disconnected cluster to redirect image references to your mirror registry.  

If you mirrored your catalog using the `oc adm catalog mirror` command, the needed image content source policy configuration is in the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file inside of the `manifests-*` directory that is created by that command. 

If you used the oc-mirror plug-in to mirror your catalog instead, the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file is within the `oc-mirror-workspace/results-*` directory create by the oc-mirror plug-in.

In either case, you can apply the policies to your disconnected command using an `oc apply` or `oc replace`
command such as:

----
oc replace -f ./<path>/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----

The required image content source policy statements can vary based on how you created your
mirror registry, but are similar to this example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageContentSourcePolicy
metadata:
  labels:
    operators.openshift.org/catalog: "true"
  name: operator-0
spec:
  repositoryDigestMirrors:
  - mirrors:
    - myregistry.example.com:5000/rhacm2
    source: registry.redhat.io/rhacm2
  - mirrors:
    - myregistry.example.com:5000/multicluster-engine
    source: registry.redhat.io/multicluster-engine
  - mirrors:
    - myregistry.example.com:5000/openshift4
    source: registry.redhat.io/openshift4
  - mirrors:
    - myregistry.example.com:5000/redhat
    source: registry.redhat.io/redhat
----

[#disconnect-install-op-and-hub]
== Install the {product-title} operator and hub cluster

After you have configured {olm} and {ocp} as previously described, you can install {product-title} by using either the OperatorHub console or a CLI. Follow the same guidance described in the xref:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online[Installing while connected online] topic.

*Important:* Creating the `MulticlusterHub` resource is the beginning of the installation process of your hub cluster.

Because operator installation on a cluster requires the use of a non-default catalog source for the mirror catalog, a special annotation is needed in the `MulticlusterHub` resource to provide the name of the mirror catalog source to the operator. The following example displays the required 
`mce-subscription-spec` annotation:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
   namespace: open-cluster-management
   name: hub
   annotations:
      installer.open-cluster-management.io/mce-subscription-spec: '{"source": "my-mirror-catalog-source"}'
spec: {}
----

The `mce-subscription-spec` annotation is required because {mce-short} is automatically installed during the {product-title-short} installation. If you are creating the resource with a CLI, include the `mce-subscription-spec` annotation in the YAML that you apply with the `oc apply` command to create the `MulticlusterHub` resource.

If you create the resource by using the OperatorHub console, switch to the _YAML view_ and insert the annotation as previously displayed. *Important:* There is no field in the OperatorHub console for the annotation in the _Field view_ panel to create the `MulticlusterHub`.
