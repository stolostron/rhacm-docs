[#upgrading]
= Upgrading 

You control your {product-title} upgrades by using the operator subscription settings in the {ocp} console. When you initially deploy {product-title-short} by using the operator, you make the following selections:

* *Channel:* Channel corresponds to the version of the product that you are installing. The initial channel setting is often the most current channel that was available at the time of installation. 

* *Approval:* Approval specifies whether approval is required for updates within the channel, or if they are done automatically. 

+
- If set to `Automatic`, then minor release (Errata) updates in the selected channel are deployed without administrator intervention. 
+
- If set to `Manual`, then each update to the minor release (Errata) within the channel requires an administrator to approve the update. 

*Required access:* {ocp-short} administrator

You also use these settings when you upgrade to the latest version of {product-title-short} by using the operator. Complete the following steps to upgrade your operator:

**Important:** You cannot revert back to an earlier version after upgrading to a later version in the channel selection. You must uninstall the operator and reinstall it with the earlier version to use a previous version.

. Log in to your {ocp-short} operator hub.

. In the {ocp-short} navigation, select *Operators* > *Installed operators*.

. Select the *{product-title}* operator.

. Select the _Subscription_ tab to edit the subscription settings.

. Ensure that the _Upgrade Status_ is labeled _Up to date_. This status indicates that the operator is at the latest level that is available in the selected channel. If the _Upgrade Status_ indicates that there is an upgrade pending, complete the following steps to update it to the latest minor release that is available in the channel:

.. Click the *Manual* setting in the _Approval_ field to edit the value. 

.. Select *Automatic* to enable automatic updates. 

.. Select *Save* to commit your change. 

.. Wait for the automatic updates to be applied to the operator. The updates automatically add the required updates to the latest version in the selected channel. When all of the updated updates are complete, the _Upgrade Status_ field indicates *Up to date*.
+
*Note:* It can take up to 10 minutes for the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource to finish upgrading. You can check whether the upgrade is still in process by entering the following command:
+
----
oc get mch
----
+
While it is upgrading, the `Status` field shows `Updating`. After upgrading is complete, the `Status` field shows `Running`.

. Now that the _Upgrade Status_ is *Up to date*, click the value in the _Channel_ field to edit it.  

. Select the channel for the next available feature release, but do not attempt to skip a channel.
+
**Important:** You cannot skip channels when upgrading. For example, you cannot skip versions 2.2.z through 2.4. 

. Select *Save* to save your changes.

. Wait for the automatic upgrade to complete. After the upgrade to the next feature release completes, the updates to the latest patch releases within the channel are deployed.

. If you have to upgrade to a later feature release, repeat steps 7-9 until your operator is at the latest level of the desired channel. Make sure that all of the patch releases are deployed for your final channel.   

. Optional: You can set your _Approval_ setting to *Manual*, if you want your future updates within the channel to require manual approvals.

For more information about upgrading your operator, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/operators/index[Operators] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

[#upgrading-clusterpools]
== Managing cluster pools with an upgrade

If you are link:../clusters_mce/cluster_lifecycle/cluster_pool_manage.adoc#managing-cluster-pools[Managing cluster pools (Technology Preview)], you need further configuration to stop automatic management of these cluster pools after upgrade.

Set `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/createmanagedcluster: "false"` in the `ClusterClaim` `metadata.annotations`. 

All existing cluster claims are automatically imported when the product is upgraded unless you change this setting.
