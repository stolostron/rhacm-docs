[#requirements-and-recommendations]
= Requirements and recommendations

Before you install {product-title}, review the following system configuration requirements and settings:

* <<supported-operating-systems-and-platforms,Supported operating systems and platforms>>
* <<supported-browsers,Supported browsers>>
* <<network-configuration,Network configuration>>

[#supported-operating-systems-and-platforms]
== Supported operating systems and platforms

See the following table for supported operating systems:

|===
| Platform | Operating system | {ocp} version

| Linux x86_64
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 (or later), or CoreOS
| Refer to the https://access.redhat.com/articles/6218901[{product-title-short} {product-version} Support matrix] for the most current list of supported {ocp-short} platforms.
|===

[#supported-browsers]
== Supported browsers

You can access the {product-title-short} console from Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
See the following versions that are tested and supported:

|===
| Platform | Supported browsers

| Microsoft Windows
| Microsoft Edge - 44 or later, Mozilla Firefox - 82.0 or later, Google Chrome - Version 86.0 and later

| Linux
| Mozilla Firefox - 82.0 and later, Google Chrome - Version 86.0 and later

| macOS
| Mozilla Firefox - 82.0 and later, Google Chrome - Version 86.0 and later, Safari - 14.0 and later
|===


[#network-configuration]
== Network configuration

Configure your network settings to allow the connections in the following sections.

[#network-configuration-hub]
=== Hub cluster networking requirements

For the hub cluster networking requirements, see the following table:

|===
| Direction | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound
| API of the cloud provider
| 

| Outbound
| Kubernetes API server of the provisioned managed cluster
| 6443

| Outbound
| The channel source, including GitHub, Object Store, and Helm repository. This is only required when you are using Application lifecycle to connect to these sources.
| 

| Outbound and inbound
| The `WorkManager` service route on the managed cluster
| 443

| Inbound
| The kube API server of the hub cluster from the managed cluster
| 6443

| Inbound
| Post-commit hook from GitHub to the hub cluster. This setting is only required when you use certain application management functions.
| 6443

|===

[#network-configuration-managed]
=== Managed cluster networking requirements

*Note:* `Registration Agent` and `Work Agent` on the managed cluster do not support proxy settings because they communicate with `apiserver` on the hub cluster by establishing an mTLS connection, which cannot pass through the proxy.

For the managed cluster networking requirements, see the following table:

|===
| Direction | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound and inbound
| Kubernetes API server of the hub cluster
| 6443

| Outbound
| The managed cluster to the channel source, which includes GitHub, Object Store, and Helm repository. This is only required when you are using application lifecycle to connect to these sources.
| 

| Inbound
| The `WorkManager` service endpoint from the hub cluster
| 443

|===

[#network-configuration-submariner]
=== Submariner networking requirements

Clusters that are using Submariner require three open ports. The following table shows which ports you might use:

|===
| Direction | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound and inbound
| Each of the managed clusters
| 4800/UDP

| Outbound and inbound
| Each of the managed clusters
| 4500/UDP, 500/UDP, and any other ports that are used for IPSec traffic on the gateway nodes

| Inbound
| Each of the managed clusters
| 8080/TCP

|===

[#network-configuration-app-deploy]
=== Application deployment network requirements

In general, the application deployment communication is one way from a managed cluster to the hub cluster. The connection uses `kubeconfig`, which is configured by the agent on the managed cluster. The application deployment on the managed cluster needs to access the following namespaces on the hub cluster:

* The namespace of the channel resource
* The namespace of the managed cluster

[#network-configuration-namespace]
=== Namespace connection network requirements

* Application lifecycle connections:
** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the console API on port 4000.
** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to expose the Application UI on port 3001.

* Application lifecycle backend components (pods):
+
On the hub cluster, all of the application lifecycle pods are installed in the `open-cluster-management` namespace, including the following pods:

** multicluster-operators-hub-subscription
** multicluster-operators-standalone-subscription
** multicluster-operators-channel
** multicluster-operators-application
** multicluster-integrations

+
As a result of these pods being in the `open-cluster-management` namespace:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.

+
On the managed cluster, only the `klusterlet-addon-appmgr` application lifecycle pod is installed in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.
    
* Governance and risk:
+
On the hub cluster, the following access is required:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.
** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the OpenShift DNS on port 5353.

+ 
On the managed cluster, the following access is required:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management-addon` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.
