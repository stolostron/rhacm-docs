[#uninstalling]
= Uninstalling

When you uninstall Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, there are two different levels of the process.

The first level is a custom resource removal.
It is the most basic type of unistallation that removes the custom resource of the MultiClusterHub instance, but leaves other required components.
This level of uninstallation is helpful if you plan another installation that uses the same settings and components of the one that you are removing.
Your time to install the next version is reduced when you have all of the other components already installed.

The second level is a more complete uninstallation, except for a few items, like custom resource definitions.
This adds the removal of other required components and settings to the items that are removed.
When you continue with this step, it removes all of the components and subscriptions that were not removed with the custom resource removal.
If you complete this level of uninstallation, you must reinstall the operator before reinstalling the custom resource.

IMPORTANT: Before you uninstall the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management hub cluster, you must detach all of the clusters that are managed by that hub cluster. For more information about detaching clusters, see the *Removing a cluster from management* section by selecting the information for your provider in  link:../manage_cluster/create.adoc#creating-a-cluster-with-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes[Creating a cluster with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes].
