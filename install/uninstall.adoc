[#uninstalling]
= Uninstalling

When you uninstall {acm}, you see two different levels of the uninstall process: A _custom resource removal_ and a _complete operator uninstall_. The uninstall process can take up to 20 minutes.

- The first level is the custom resource removal, which is the most basic type of uninstall that removes the custom resource of the `MultiClusterHub` instance, but leaves other required operator resources. This level of uninstall is helpful if you plan to reinstall using the same settings and components.

- The second level is a more complete uninstall that removes most operator components, excluding components such as custom resource definitions. When you continue with this step, it removes all of the components and subscriptions that were not removed with the custom resource removal. After this uninstall, you must reinstall the operator before reinstalling the custom resource.

[#prerequisite-detach]
== Prerequisites

Before you uninstall the {acm-short} hub cluster, you must detach all of the clusters that are managed by that hub cluster. Detach all clusters that are still managed by the hub cluster, then try to uninstall again.

* If you use Discovery, you might see the following error when you attempt uninstall:

+
[source,bash]
----
Cannot delete MultiClusterHub resource because DiscoveryConfig resource(s) exist
----

+
To disable Discovery, complete the following steps:

- From the console, navigate to the `Discovered Clusters` table and click *Disable cluster discovery*. Confirm that you want to remove the service. 

- You can also use the terminal. Run the following command to disable Discover:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc delete discoveryconfigs --all --all-namespaces
----

* If you have agent service configurations attached, you might see the following message:

+
[source,bash]
----
Cannot delete MultiClusterHub resource because AgentServiceConfig resource(s) exist
----
+
- To disable and remove the `AgentServiceConfig` by using the command line interface, see the following steps:

.. Log in to your hub cluster.

.. Delete the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource by entering the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc delete agentserviceconfig --all
----

* If you have managed clusters attached, you might see the following message. *Note:* This does not include the `local-cluster`, which is your self-managed hub cluster:
 
+
[source,bash]
----
Cannot delete MultiClusterHub resource because ManagedCluster resource(s) exist
----

+
For more information about detaching clusters, see the _Removing a cluster from management_ section by selecting the information for your provider in link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/create_intro.adoc#create-intro[Cluster creation introduction]. 

* If you have Observability, you might see the following message:

+
[source,bash]
----
Cannot delete MultiClusterHub resource because MultiClusterObservability resource(s) exist
----
+
- To disable and remove the `MultiClusterObservability` using the command line interface, complete the following steps:

.. Log in to your hub cluster.

.. Delete the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource by entering the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc delete mco observability
----

+
- To remove `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource with the console, see the following procedure:

.. If the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource is installed, select the tab for _MultiClusterObservability_.

.. Select the *Options* menu for the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource. 

.. Select *Delete MultiClusterObservability*. 
+
When you delete the resource, the pods in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace on {acm-short} hub cluster, and the pods in `open-cluster-management-addon-observability` namespace on all managed clusters are removed. 
+
*Note:* Your object storage is not affected after you remove the observability service.

[#removing-a-multiclusterhub-instance-by-using-commands]
== Removing resources by using commands

. If you have not already. ensure that your {ocp-short} CLI is configured to run `oc` commands. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information about how to configure the `oc` commands. 

. Change to your project namespace by entering the following command. Replace _namespace_ with the name of your project namespace:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc project <namespace>
----

. Enter the following command to remove the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc delete multiclusterhub --all
----

. To view the progress enter the following command: 

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get mch -o yaml
----

. Remove any potential remaining artifacts by running the clean-up script. Run this clean-up script if you plan to reinstall with an older version of {acm-short} on the same cluster. 

.. Copy the following script into a file:

+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
ACM_NAMESPACE=<namespace>
oc delete mch --all -n $ACM_NAMESPACE
oc delete apiservice v1.admission.cluster.open-cluster-management.io v1.admission.work.open-cluster-management.io

+
Replace `<namespace>` in the script with the name of the namespace where {acm-short} was installed.
+
*Important:* Ensure that you specify the correct namespace, as the namespace is cleaned out and deleted.

.. Run the script to remove any possible artifacts that remain from the previous installation. If there are no remaining artifacts, a message is returned that no resources were found.
+
*Note:* If you plan to reinstall the same {acm-short} version, you can skip the next steps in this procedure and reinstall the custom resource. Proceed for a complete operator uninstall.

+
. Enter the following commands to delete the {acm-short} `ClusterServiceVersion` and `Subscription` in the namespace where it is installed. Replace the `2.x.0` value with the current major or minor release:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get csv

oc delete sub acm-operator-subscription
----
+
*Note:* The name of the subscription and version of the CSV might differ.

[#deleting-the-components-by-using-the-console]
== Deleting the components by using the console

When you use the {ocp} console to uninstall, you remove the operator. Complete the following steps to uninstall by using the console:

. In the {ocp-short} console navigation, select *Operators* > *Installed Operators* > *Advanced Cluster Manager for Kubernetes*.

. Remove the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource.
.. Select the tab for _Multiclusterhub_.

.. Select the *Options* menu for the MultiClusterHub custom resource.

.. Select *Delete MultiClusterHub*.

. Run the clean-up script according to the procedure in xref:../install/uninstall.adoc#removing-a-multiclusterhub-instance-by-using-commands[Removing a MultiClusterHub instance by using commands].
+
*Note:* If you plan to reinstall the same {acm-short} version, you can skip the rest of the steps in this procedure and reinstall the custom resource.

. Navigate to *Installed Operators*.

. Remove the _{acm-short}_ operator by selecting the _Options_ menu and selecting *Uninstall operator*.
