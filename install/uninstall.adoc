[#uninstalling]
= Uninstalling

When you uninstall {product-title}, you see two different levels of the process: A _custom resource removal_ and a _complete operator uninstall_. It might take up to 20 minutes to complete the uninstall process.

- The custom resource removal is the most basic type of uninstall that removes the custom resource of the `MultiClusterHub` instance, but leaves other required components. This level of uninstall is helpful if you plan another installation that uses the same settings and components of the one that you are removing. Your time to install the next version is reduced when all other components already installed.

- The second level is a more complete operator uninstall, except for a few items, such as custom resource definitions. This adds the removal of other required components and settings to the items that are removed.
When you continue with this step, it removes all of the components and subscriptions that were not removed with the custom resource removal. After this uninstall, you must reinstall the operator before reinstalling the custom resource.

[#prerequisite-detach]
== Prerequisite: Detach enabled services

Before you uninstall the {product-title-short} hub cluster, you must detach all of the clusters that are managed by that hub cluster. To avoid errors, detach all clusters that are still managed by the hub cluster, then try to uninstall again.

* If you use Discovery, you might see the following error when you attempt uninstall:
+
----
Cannot delete MultiClusterHub resource because DiscoveryConfig resource(s) exist
----
+

+
To disable Discovery, complete the following steps:

- From the console Navigate to the `Discovered Clusters` table and click *Disable cluster discovery*. Confirm that you want to remove the service. 

- You can also use the terminal. Run the following command to disable Discover:

+
----
$ oc delete discoveryconfigs --all --all-namespaces
----

* If you have managed clusters attached, you might see the following message. *Note* This does not include the `local-cluster`, which is your self-managed hub cluster.
* 

+
----
Cannot delete MultiClusterHub resource because ManagedCluster resource(s) exist
----

+
For more information about detaching clusters, see the _Removing a cluster from management_ section by selecting the information for your provider in link:../clusters/create.adoc#creating-a-cluster[Creating a cluster]. 

* If you have Bare metal assets, you might see the following:

+ 
----
Cannot delete MultiClusterHub resource because BareMetalAssets resource(s) exist
----
+
For more information about removing the bare metal assets, see link:../clusters/bare_assets.adoc#removing-a-bare-metal-asset[Removing a bare metal asset].

* If you have Observability, you might see the following:

+
----
Cannot delete MultiClusterHub resource because MultiClusterObservability resource(s) exist
----
+
To disable and remove the `MultiClusterObservability`, see the following procedure:

.. Log in to your hub cluster.

.. Delete the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource by entering the following command:
+
----
oc delete mco observability
----

+
When you delete the resource, the pods in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace on {product-title-short} hub cluster, and the pods in `open-cluster-management-addon-observability` namespace on all managed clusters are removed. 

+
*Note*: Your object storage is not affected after you remove the observability service.

[#removing-a-multiclusterhub-instance-by-using-commands]
== Removing resources by using commands

. If you have not already. ensure that your {ocp-short} CLI is configured to run `oc` commands. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.7/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information about how to configure the `oc` commands. 

. Change to your project namespace by entering the following command. Replace _namespace_ with the name of your project namespace:

+
----
oc project <namespace>
----

. Enter the following command to remove the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource:

+
----
oc delete multiclusterhub --all
----
+
You can view the progress by entering the following command: 
+
----
oc get mch -o yaml
----

. Remove any potential remaining artifacts by running the clean-up script. 

.. Install the Helm CLI binary version 3.2.0, or later, by following the instructions at https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Installing Helm].

.. Copy the following script into a file:
+
----
#!/bin/bash
ACM_NAMESPACE=<namespace>
oc delete mch --all -n $ACM_NAMESPACE
helm ls --namespace $ACM_NAMESPACE | cut -f 1 | tail -n +2 | xargs -n 1 helm delete --namespace $ACM_NAMESPACE
oc delete apiservice v1beta2.webhook.certmanager.k8s.io v1.admission.cluster.open-cluster-management.io v1.admission.work.open-cluster-management.io
oc delete clusterimageset --all
oc delete configmap -n $ACM_NAMESPACE cert-manager-controller cert-manager-cainjector-leader-election cert-manager-cainjector-leader-election-core
oc delete consolelink acm-console-link
oc delete crd klusterletaddonconfigs.agent.open-cluster-management.io placementbindings.policy.open-cluster-management.io policies.policy.open-cluster-management.io userpreferences.console.open-cluster-management.io searchservices.search.acm.com 
oc delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration cert-manager-webhook cert-manager-webhook-v1alpha1
oc delete oauthclient multicloudingress
oc delete rolebinding -n kube-system cert-manager-webhook-webhook-authentication-reader
oc delete scc kui-proxy-scc
oc delete validatingwebhookconfiguration cert-manager-webhook cert-manager-webhook-v1alpha1
----
+
Replace `<namespace>` in the script with the name of the namespace where {product-title-short} was installed. Ensure that you specify the correct namespace, as the namespace is cleaned out and deleted. 

.. Run the script to remove any possible artifacts that remain from the previous installation. If there are no remaining artifacts, a message is returned that no resources were found.
+
*Tip:* If you plan to reinstall a new version and want to keep your other information, you can skip the rest of the steps in this procedure and reinstall.

. Enter the following command to remove all of the related components and subscriptions:
+
----
oc delete subs --all
----

. Enter the following command to delete the `ClusterServiceVersion`:
+
----
oc delete clusterserviceversion --all
----

[#deleting-the-components-by-using-the-console]
== Deleting the components by using the console

When you use the {ocp} console to uninstall, you remove the operator. Complete the following steps to uninstall by using the console:

. In the {ocp-short} console navigation, select *Operators* > *Installed Operators* > *Advanced Cluster Manager for Kubernetes*.

. Remove the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource, if installed.

.. If the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource is installed, select the tab for _MultiClusterObservability_.

.. Select the _Options_ menu for the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource. 

.. Select *Delete MultiClusterObservability*. 

. Remove the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource.
.. Select the tab for _Multiclusterhub_.

.. Select the _Options_ menu for the MultiClusterHub custom resource.

.. Select *Delete MultiClusterHub*.

. Run the clean-up script according to the procedure in xref:../install/uninstall.adoc#removing-a-multiclusterhub-instance-by-using-commands[Removing a MultiClusterHub instance by using commands].

+
*Tip:* If you plan to reinstall a new version and want to keep your other information, you can skip the rest of the steps in this procedure and reinstall.

. Navigate to *Installed Operators*.

. Remove the _Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management_ operator by selecting the _Options_ menu and selecting *Uninstall operator*.
