[#migrating-from-1.0-to-2.0]
== Migrating from 1.0 to 2.0

Upgrade from version 1.0 of {product-title-short} to version 2.0 is not supported. To _migrate_ from the technology preview version of {product-title} 1.0 to the generally available version 2.0, you must manually remove version 1.0 and install version 2.0. Complete the following steps to migrate from version 1.0 to version 2.0:

. Detach each of your managed clusters from your {product-title-short} hub cluster before unistalling the hub cluster. See link:../manage_cluster/create_ocp_aws.adoc#aws_removing-a-cluster-from-management[Removing a cluster from management] for instructions that explain how to remove the managed clusters.

. Uninstall {product-title-short} version 1.0 by completing the procedure in xref:../install/uninstalling.adoc#uninstalling[Uninstalling].

. Install {product-title-short} version 2.0 by completing the procedure in xref:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online[Installing while connected online].
+
When you install version 2.0, select *automatic upgrade* to enable automatic upgrades for future versions within the same major release. If you prefer to run manual updates, you can select *manual upgrade*. See the following definitions of the options:
+
* Automatic upgrade: If you select automatic upgrades when you install the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management operator, the Operator Lifecycle Manager automatically upgrades the version when a compatible upgrade is available. This method ensures that you always have the latest version of the operator with the latest fixes.

* Manual upgrade: If you select manual upgrades when you install the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management operator, the cluster administrator determines when an upgrade occurs.
+
When a compatible upgrade is available, the Operator Lifecycle Manager creates a request to upgrade. A cluster administrator must approve the request to upgrade the version.

. Import the clusters to the version 2.0 hub cluster by completing the procedure in link:../manage_cluster/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster]. 

For more information about upgrading your operator, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.4/html/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Adding operators to a cluster].
