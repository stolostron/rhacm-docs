[#sizing-your-cluster]
= Sizing your cluster

Each {acm} cluster is unique and the following guidelines give sample deployment sizes for you. Recommendations are classified by size and purpose. 

{acm-short} applies the following dimensions for sizing and placement of supporting services:

* _Availability zones_ isolate potential fault domains across the cluster. Typical clusters have near equal worker node capacity in three or more availability zones. 

* _vCPU reservations and limits_ establish vCPU capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. A vCPU is equal to a Kubernetes compute unit. For more information, see Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-cpu[Meaning of CPU].

* _Memory reservations and limits_ establish memory capacity on a worker node to assign to a container.
 
* _Persistent data_ is managed by the product and stored in the etcd cluster that is used by Kubernetes. 

*Important:* For {ocp-short}, distribute the master nodes of the cluster across three availability zones.

In addition to {acm-short}, the {ocp-short} cluster runs additional services to support cluster features. See xref:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-on-infra-node[Installing the {acm-short} hub cluster on infrastructure nodes] for more details.

IBM Z systems provide the ability to configure simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which extends the number of vCPUs that can run on each core. If you configured SMT, One physical core (IFL) provides two logical cores (threads). The hypervisor can provide two or more vCPUs.

One vCPU is equal to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyper-threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.

For more information about SMT, see link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=concepts-simultaneous-multithreading[Simultaneous multithreading].

IBM Power systems provide the ability to configure simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which extends the number of vCPUs that can run on each core. If you configured SMT, your SMT level determines how you satisfy the 16 vCPU requirement. The most common configurations are:

Two cores running on SMT-8 (the default configuration for systems that are running IBM Power VM) provides the required 16 vCPUs.

Four cores running on SMT-4 provides the required 16 vCPUs. 

For more information about SMT, see link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=concepts-simultaneous-multithreading[Simultaneous multithreading].

A {acm} hub cluster can be installed and supported on {ocp-short} bare metal. The hub cluster can run on a compact bare metal topology, in which there are 3 schedulable control plane nodes, and 0 additional workers.

=== Creating and managing single node {ocp-short} clusters

View link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/installing_on_a_single_node[Installing on a single node] to learn about the requirements. Since each cluster is unique, the following guidelines provide only sample deployment requirements that are classified by size and purpose. 

_Availability zones_ isolate potential fault domains across the cluster. Typical clusters have an equal worker node capacity in three or more availability zones. High availability is not supported.

*Important:* For {ocp-short}, distribute the master nodes of the cluster across three availability zones.

See example requirements for creating and managing 3500 single node {ocp-short} clusters. See the minimum requirements for using {acm-short} to create {sno} clusters (230 and more provisioned at the same time), and manage those {sno} clusters with a hub cluster:
