[#sizing-your-cluster]
= Sizing your hub cluster

Each {product-title} cluster is unique and the following guidelines provide sample deployment sizes for you. Recommendations are classified by size and purpose. {product-title-short} applies the following dimensions for sizing and placement of supporting services:

* Availability Zones isolate potential fault domains across the cluster. Typical clusters should have nearly equivalent worker node capacity in three or more availability zones. 

* vCPU reservations and limits, which establish vCPU capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. A vCPU is equivalent to a Kubernetes compute unit. For more information, see Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-cpu[Meaning of CPU].

* Memory reservations and limits, which establish memory capacity on a worker node to assign to a container. 
* Persistent data, which is managed by the product and stored in the etcd cluster that is used by Kubernetes. 

*Best practice:* For {ocp-short}, distribute the master nodes of the cluster across three (3) availability zones.

[#product-environment]
== Product environment

**Note:** The following requirements are _not_ minimum requirements.

* Master node
 ** Availability zones: 3
 ** etcd: 3
 ** Total reserved memory: Per {ocp-short} sizing guidelines
 ** Total reserved CPU: Per {ocp-short} sizing guidelines

* Worker node
 ** Availability zones: 3
 ** redisgraph/redis: 1
 ** Total reserved memory: 12 GB
 ** Total reserved CPU: 6

In addition to {product-title-short}, the {ocp-short} cluster runs additional services to support cluster features. The following node sizes (3 nodes of the types noted in the information that follows, distributed evenly across 3 availability zones) are recommended.

[#openshift-cluster-on-z]
=== {ocp-short} on IBM Z systems

See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html-single/installing/index#installing-ibm-z[Installing a cluster on IBM Z systems] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information.

IBM Z systems provide the ability to configure simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which extends the number of vCPUs that can run on each core. If you configured SMT, One physical core (IFL) provides two logical cores (threads). The hypervisor can provide two or more vCPUs.
+
One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.

For more information about SMT, see https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=concepts-simultaneous-multithreading[Simultaneous multithreading].

[#openshift-cluster-on-power-systems]
=== {ocp-short} on IBM Power systems

See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html-single/installing/index#installing-on-ibm-power-systems[Installing a cluster on Power systems] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information.

* Node count: 3 
* Availability zones: 3								
* Instance size:
** Memory: 16 GB
** Storage size: 120 GB
** vCPU: 16
+
IBM Power systems provide the ability to configure simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which extends the number of vCPUs that can run on each core. If you configured SMT, your SMT level determines how you satisfy the 16 vCPU requirement. The most common configurations are:
+
*** Two cores running on SMT-8 (the default configuration for systems that are running IBM PowerVM) provides the required 16 vCPUs.
*** Four cores running on SMT-4 provides the required 16 vCPUs. 
+
For more information about SMT, see https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=concepts-simultaneous-multithreading[Simultaneous multithreading].

[#single-node]
=== Creating and managing single node {ocp-short} clusters

See example requirements for creating and managing 2200 single node OpenShift Container Platform clusters. See the minimum requirements for using {product-title-short} to create single node OpenShift (SNO) clusters (230 and more provisioned at the same time), and manage those SNO clusters with a hub cluster:

 * Master (schedulable)
   ** Node count: 3
   ** Memory: 289 GB (cluster max)
   ** Memory: 110 GB (single node max)
   ** CPU cluster max: 90 
   ** CPU single node max: 44 

*Note:* The CPU utilization values peaked while multiple clusters were created at the same time.
