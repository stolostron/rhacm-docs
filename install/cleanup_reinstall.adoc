[#cleanup-reinstall]
= Cleaning up artifacts before reinstalling

Before you reinstall {acm} on a cluster where a previous version was installed and then deleted, you need to remove artifacts.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator. 

*{ocp-short} Dedicated environment required access:* You must have `cluster-admin` permissions.

[#cleanup-artifacts]
== Cleaning up artifacts

Remove all artifacts that remain by running the clean-up script. You need to clean up artifacts if you plan to reinstall {acm-short} with an older version of {acm-short} on the same cluster. 

. Copy the following script into a file, replacing the `<namespace>` value in the script with the name of the namespace where you previously installed {acm-short}. 

+
*Important:* Ensure that you specify the correct namespace because the namespace is also cleaned out and deleted when you run the script.
