- Cleanup Before Reinstalling

Before reinstalling {acm} on a cluster or a previous version has been installed and deleted, some cleanup may be required

**Required access:** Cluster administrator. 
**{ocp-short} Dedicated environment required access:** You must have `cluster-admin` permissions. By default `dedicated-admin` role does not have the required permissions to create namespaces in the {ocp-short} Dedicated environment. 

- The following guide assumes that you have the same cluster access described in the install connnected or disconnected guides


. Remove any potential remaining artifacts by running the clean-up script. Run this clean-up script if you plan to reinstall with an older version of {acm-short} on the same cluster. 

.. Copy the following script into a file:

+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
ACM_NAMESPACE=<namespace>
oc delete mch --all -n $ACM_NAMESPACE
oc delete apiservice v1.admission.cluster.open-cluster-management.io v1.admission.work.open-cluster-management.io
oc delete clusterimageset --all

Replace `<namespace>` in the script with the name of the namespace where {acm-short} was installed.

+
*Important:* Ensure that you specify the correct namespace, as the namespace is cleaned out and deleted.

+
.. Run the script to remove any possible artifacts that remain from the previous installation. If there are no remaining artifacts, a message is returned that no resources were found.
+

+
.. At this point, you may proceed with the install
