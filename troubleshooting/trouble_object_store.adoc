= Troubleshooting Object storage channel secret

If you change the `SecretAccessKey`, the subscription of an Object storage channel cannot pick up the updated secret automatically and you receive an error.

[#symptom-object-storage-channel-secret]
== Symptom: Object storage channel secret

The subscription of an Object storage channel cannot pick up the updated secret automatically. This prevents the subscription operator from reconciliation and deploys resources from Object storage to the managed cluster.

[#resolving-the-problem-object-storage-channel-secret]
== Resolving the problem: Object storage channel secret

You need to manually input the credentials to create a secret, then refer to the secret within a channel.

. Annotate the subscription CR in order to generate a reconcile single to subscription
operator. See the following `data` specification:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: deva
  namespace: ch-obj
  labels:
    name: obj-sub
spec:
  type: ObjectBucket
  pathname: http://ec2-100-26-232-156.compute-1.amazonaws.com:9000/deva
  sourceNamespaces:
    - default
  secretRef:
    name: dev
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:

  namespace: ch-obj
  labels:
    name: obj-sub
data:
  AccessKeyID: YWRtaW4=
  SecretAccessKey: cGFzc3dvcmRhZG1pbg==
----

. Run `oc annotate` to test:

+
----
oc annotate appsub -n <subscription-namespace> <subscription-name> test=true
----

After you run the command, you can go to the Application console to verify that the resource is deployed to the managed cluster. Or you can log in to the managed cluster to see if the application resource is created at the given namespace.
