= Troubleshooting Klusterlet application manager on managed clusters

When you upgrade from {product-title}, the `klusterlet-addon-appmgr` pod on {ocp} managed clusters version 4.5 and 4.6 are `OOMKilled`.

== Symptom: Klusterlet application manager on managed cluster

You receive an error for the `klusterlet-addon-appmgr` pod on {ocp} managed clusters version 4.5 and 4.6: `OOMKilled`.

== Resolving the problem: Klusterlet application manager on managed cluster

For {product-title} 2.1.x and 2.2, you need to manually increase the memory limit of the pod to `8Gb`. See the following steps.

. On your hub cluster, annotate the `klusterletaddonconfig` to pause replication. See the following command:

+
----
oc annotate klusterletaddonconfig -n ${CLUSTER_NAME} ${CLUSTER_NAME} klusterletaddonconfig-pause=true --  overwrite=true
----

. On your hub cluster, scale down the `klusterlet-addon-operator`. See the following command:

+
----
oc edit manifestwork ${CLUSTER_NAME}-klusterlet-addon-operator -n ${CLUSTER_NAME}
----

. Find the `klusterlet-addon-operator` Deployment and add `replicas: 0` to the spec to scale down.

+
----
- apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: cluster1
    name: klusterlet-addon-operator
    namespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
    spec:
      replicas: 0
----

On the managed cluster, the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon/klusterlet-addon-operator` pod will be terminated.

. Log in to the managed cluster to manually increase the memory limit in the `appmgr` pod. 

Run the following command:

----
% oc edit deployments -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon klusterlet-addon-appmgr
----

For example, if the limit is 5G, increase the limit to 8G.

----
resources:
  limits:
    memory: 2Gi  -> 8Gi 
  requests:
    memory: 128Mi -> 256Mi
