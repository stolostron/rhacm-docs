error log:
Warning: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1 CustomResourceDefinition is deprecated in v1.16+, unavailable in v1.22+; use apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 CustomResourceDefinition
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "STDIN": customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io "klusterlets.operator.open-cluster-management.io" already exists
The cluster cannot be imported because its Klusterlet CRD already exists.

Detach the existing cluster before trying the import again."
