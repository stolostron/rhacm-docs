An error log shows up when importing an {ocp-short} cluster into {acm-short} `MultiClusterHub`:

----
error log:
Warning: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1 CustomResourceDefinition is deprecated in v1.16+, unavailable in v1.22+; use apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 CustomResourceDefinition
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "STDIN": customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io "klusterlets.operator.open-cluster-management.io" already exists
The cluster cannot be imported because its Klusterlet CRD already exists.
Either the cluster was already imported, or it was not detached completely during a previous detach process.
Detach the existing cluster before trying the import again."

----

Run the following commands to remove pre-existing resources:

----
oc delete namespaces open-cluster-management-agent open-cluster-management-agent-addon --wait=false
oc get crds | grep open-cluster-management.io | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete crds --wait=false
oc get crds | grep open-cluster-management.io | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc patch crds --type=merge -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers": []}}'
