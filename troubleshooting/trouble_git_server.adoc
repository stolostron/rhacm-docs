= Troubleshooting application Git server connection 

Logs from the `open-cluster-management` namespace display failure to clone the Git repository.

[#symptom-git-server]
== Symptom: Git server connection 

The logs from the subscription controller pod `multicluster-operators-hub-subscription-<random-characters>` in the `open-cluster-management` namespace indicates that it fails to clone the Git repository. You receive a `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` error, or `BadGateway` error.
 
[#resolving-git-server]
== Resolving the problem: Git server connection 

*Important:* Upgrade if you are on a previous version.

. Save link:https://github.com/stolostron/multicloud-operators-channel/blob/master/deploy/crds/apps.open-cluster-management.io_channels_crd.yaml[apps.open-cluster-management.io_channels_crd.yaml] as the same file name.

. On the {product-title-short} cluster, run the following command to apply the file: 

+
----
oc apply -f apps.open-cluster-management.io_channels_crd.yaml
----

. In the `open-cluster-management` namespace, edit the `advanced-cluster-management.<version, example 2.5.0>` CSV, run the following command and edit:

+
----
oc edit csv advanced-cluster-management.<version, example 2.5.0> -n open-cluster-management
----

+
Find the following containers:

+
- `multicluster-operators-standalone-subscription` 
- `multicluster-operators-hub-subscription` 

+
Replace the container images with the container that you want to use:

+
----
quay.io/open-cluster-management/multicluster-operators-subscription:<your image tag>
---- 

+
The update recreates the following pods in the `open-cluster-management` namespace: 


- `multicluster-operators-standalone-subscription-<random-characters>`

- `multicluster-operators-hub-subscription-<random-characters>` 

. Check that the new pods are running with the new docker image. Run the following command, then find the new docker image:
+
----
oc get pod multicluster-operators-standalone-subscription-<random-characters> -n open-cluster-management -o yaml
oc get pod multicluster-operators-hub-subscription-<random-characters> -n open-cluster-management -o yaml
----

. Update the images on managed clusters. 

+
On the hub cluster, run the following command to update the image value in the `multicluster_operators_subscription` key to the image that you want to use:

+
----
oc edit configmap -n open-cluster-management mch-image-manifest-<version, example 2.5.0>
...
data:
multicluster_operators_subscription: <your image with tag>
----

. Restart the existing `multicluster-operators-hub-subscription` pod:

+
----
oc delete pods -n open-cluster-management multicluster-operators-hub-subscription--<random-characters>
----

+
This recreates the `application-manager-<random-characters>` pod in `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace on the managed cluster. 

. Check that the new pod is running with the new docker image.

. When you create an application through the console or the CLI, add `insecureSkipVerify: true' in the channel spec manually. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
labels:
  name: sample-channel
  namespace: sample
spec:
  type: GitHub
  pathname: <Git URL>
  insecureSkipVerify: true
