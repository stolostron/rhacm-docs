= Troubleshooting imported clusters offline after certificate change

Installing a custom `apiserver` certificate is supported, but one or more clusters that were imported before you changed the certificate information are in `offline` status. 

[#symptom-clusters-offline-after-certificate-change]
== Symptom: Clusters offline after certificate change

After you complete the procedure for updating a certificate secret, one or more of your clusters that were online now display `offline` status in the console.

== Identifying the problem: Clusters offline after certificate change 

After updating the information for a custom API server certificate, clusters that were imported and running before the new certificate are now in an `offline` state. 

The errors that indicate that the certificate is the problem are found in the logs for the pods in the `open-cluster-management-agent` namespace of the offline managed cluster. The following examples are similar to the errors that are displayed in the logs:

[#resolving-clusters-offline-after-certificate-change]
== Resolving the problem: Clusters offline after certificate change

If your managed cluster is the `local-cluster`, or your managed cluster was created by using {acm}, you must wait 10 minutes or longer to reimport your managed cluster.

To reimport your managed cluster immediately, you can delete your managed cluster import secret on the hub cluster and reimport it by using {acm-short}. Run the following command:

----
oc delete secret -n <cluster_name> <cluster_name>-import
----

Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of the managed cluster that you want to import.

If you want to reimport a managed cluster that was imported by using {acm-short}, complete the following steps to import the managed cluster again:

. On the hub cluster, recreate the managed cluster import secret by running the following command:
+
----
oc delete secret -n <cluster_name> <cluster_name>-import
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of the managed cluster that you want to import.

. On the hub cluster, expose the managed cluster import secret to a YAML file by running the following command:
+
----
oc get secret -n <cluster_name> <cluster_name>-import -ojsonpath='{.data.import\.yaml}' | base64 --decode  > import.yaml
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of the managed cluster that you want to import.

. On the managed cluster, apply the `import.yaml` file by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f import.yaml
----

*Note:* The previous steps do not detach the managed cluster from the hub cluster. The steps update the required manifests with current settings on the managed cluster, including the new certificate information.
