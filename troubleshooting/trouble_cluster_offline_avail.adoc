= Troubleshooting cluster status changing from offline to available

When the network that connects the managed cluster to the hub cluster is unstable, the status of the managed cluster that is reported by the hub cluster cycles between `offline` and `available`. 

[#symptom-cluster-status-changing-from-offline-to-available]
== Symptom: Cluster status changing from offline to available

After a cluster is deployed, the cluster status changes from `offline` to `available`. The status continues to cycle between the two statuses.

== Identifying the problem: Cluster status changing from offline to available

The status of a deployed cluster alternates from `offline` to `available` without any manual changes to the environment or cluster.

== Resolving the problem: Cluster status changing from offline to available

To attempt to resolve this issue, complete the following steps:

. Edit your `ManagedCluster` specification on the hub cluster by entering the following command:
+
----
oc edit managedcluster <cluster-name>
----
Replace _cluster-name_ with the name of your managed cluster.

. Increase the value of `leaseDurationSeconds` in your `ManagedCluster` specification. The default value is 5 minutes, but that might not be enough time to maintain the connection with the network issues. Specify a greater amount of time for the lease. For example, you can raise the setting to 20 minutes.
