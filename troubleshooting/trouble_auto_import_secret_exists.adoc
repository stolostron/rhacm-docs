[#resolving--auto-import-secrets-exists]
== Resolving the problem: Auto-import-secret-exists error when importing a cluster

This problem occurs when you attempt to import a cluster that was previously managed by {product-title-short}. When this happens, the secrets conflict when you try to reimport the cluster. 

To work around this problem, complete the following steps:

. To manually delete the existing `auto-import-secret`, run the following command on the hub cluster:
+
----
oc delete secret auto-import-secret -n <cluster-namespace>
----
+
Replace `cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your cluster.

. Import your cluster again using the procedure in link:../clusters_mce/cluster_lifecycle/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to a hub cluster].

Your cluster is imported.
