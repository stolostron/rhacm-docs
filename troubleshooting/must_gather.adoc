[#running-the-must-gather-command-to-troubleshoot]
= Running the must-gather command to troubleshoot

To get started with troubleshooting, learn about the troubleshooting scenarios for users to run the `must-gather` command to debug the issues, then see the procedures to start using the command.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#scenarios]
== Must-gather scenarios

* *Scenario one:* Use the xref:../troubleshooting/troubleshooting_intro.adoc#documented-troubleshooting[Documented troubleshooting] section to see if a solution to your problem is documented. The guide is organized by the major functions of the product.

+
With this scenario, you check the guide to see if your solution is in the documentation. For instance, for trouble with creating a cluster, you might find a solution in the _Manage cluster_ section. 
+

* *Scenario two:* If your problem is not documented with steps to resolve, run the `must-gather` command and use the output to debug the issue.

* *Scenario three:* If you cannot debug the issue using your output from the `must-gather` command, then share your output with Red Hat Support.

[#procedure]
== Must-gather procedure

See the following procedure to start using the `must-gather` command:

. Learn about the `must-gather` command and install the prerequisites that you need at link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/support/gathering-cluster-data.html[Gathering data about your cluster] in the {ocp} documentation.

. Log in to your cluster. Add the {product-title} image that is used for gathering data and the directory. Run the following command, where you insert the image and the directory for the output:
+
----
oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/acm-must-gather-rhel8:v2.10 --dest-dir=<directory>
----

. For the usual use-case, you should run the `must-gather` while you are logged into your _hub_ cluster. 

+
*Note:* If you want to check your managed clusters, find the `gather-managed.log` file that is located in the `cluster-scoped-resources` directory:
+
----
<your-directory>/cluster-scoped-resources/gather-managed.log>
----
+
Check for managed clusters that are not set `True` for the JOINED and AVAILABLE column. You can run the `must-gather` command on those clusters that are not connected with `True` status.

. Go to your specified directory to see your output, which is organized in the following levels:

 - Two peer levels: `cluster-scoped-resources` and `namespace` resources.
 - Sub-level for each: API group for the custom resource definitions for both cluster-scope and namespace-scoped resources.
 - Next level for each: YAML file sorted by `kind`.

[#must-gather-disconnected]
== Must-gather in a disconnected environment

Complete the following steps to run the `must-gather` command in a disconnected environment: 

. In a disconnected environment, mirror the Red Hat operator catalog images into their mirror registry. For more information, see link:../install/install_disconnected.adoc#install-on-disconnected-networks[Install on disconnected networks].

. Run the following commands to collect all of the information, replacing `<2.x>` with the supported version for both `<acm-must-gather>`, for example `2.10`, and `<multicluster-engine/must-gather>`, for example `2.5`.
+
----
REGISTRY=<internal.repo.address:port>
IMAGE1=$REGISTRY/rhacm2/acm-must-gather-rhel8:v<2.x>
oc adm must-gather --image=$IMAGE1 --dest-dir=<directory>
----

If you experience issues with one of the currently supported releases, or the product documentation, go to link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/support[Red Hat Support] where you can troubleshoot further, view Knowledgebase articles, connect with the Support Team, or open a case. You must log in with your Red Hat credentials.
