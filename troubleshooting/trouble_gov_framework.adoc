[#symptom-gov-framework]
== Symptom: Troubleshooting the compliance events for clusters 

You may see log messages such as this, indicating the issue. If the message value is empty in the log message, this usually indicates the policy compliance history API could not be reached. A likely cause is the policy compliance history API URL is not correct or there is a network communication issue.
