= Managed cluster creation fails on Red Hat OpenStack Platform with unknown authority error

If you experience a problem when creating a {ocp} cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform, see the following troubleshooting information to see if one of them addresses your problem.

[#symptom-openstack-fails]
== Symptom: Managed cluster creation fails with unknown authority error

[#identifying-the-problem-openstack-fails]
== Identifying the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with unknown authority error

The deployment of the managed cluster fails and returns the following error message:

`x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

[#resolving-the-problem-openstack-fails]
== Resolving the problem: Managed cluster creation fails with unknown authority error

Verify that the following files are configured correctly:

. The `clouds.yaml` file must specify the path to the `ca.crt` file in the `cacert` parameter. The `cacert` parameter is passed to the OpenShift installer when generating the ignition shim. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
clouds:
  openstack:
    cacert: "/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ca.crt"
----

. The `certificatesSecretRef` paremeter must reference a secret with a file name matching the `ca.crt` file. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  baseDomain: dev09.red-chesterfield.com
  clusterName: txue-osspoke
  platform:
    openstack:
      cloud: openstack
      credentialsSecretRef:
        name: txue-osspoke-openstack-creds
      certificatesSecretRef:
        name: txue-osspoke-openstack-certificatebundle
----
+
To create a secret with a matching file name, run the following command:
+
```
oc create secret generic txue-osspoke-openstack-certificatebundle --from-file=ca.crt=ca.crt.pem -n $CLUSTERNAME
```
+
. The size of the `ca.cert` file must be less than 63 thousand bytes.
