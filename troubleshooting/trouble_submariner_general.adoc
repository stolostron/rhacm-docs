If the network connectivity is not established after deploying Submariner, begin the troubleshooting steps. Note that it might take several minutes for the processes to complete when you deploy Submariner.

[#resolving-trouble-submariner-general]
== Resolving the problem: Submariner not connecting after installation

When Submariner does not run correctly after deployment, complete the following steps:

. Check for the following requirements to determine whether the components of Submariner deployed correctly:
+
* The `submariner-addon` pod is running in the `open-cluster-management` namespace of your hub cluster. 

* The following pods are running in the `submariner-operator` namespace of each managed cluster:
+
** submariner-addon
** submariner-gateway
** submariner-routeagent
** submariner-operator
** submariner-globalnet (only if Globalnet is enabled in the ClusterSet)
** submariner-lighthouse-agent
** submariner-lighthouse-coredns
** submariner-networkplugin-syncer (only if the specified CNI value is `OVNKubernetes`)
** submariner-metrics-proxy

. Run the `subctl diagnose all` command to check the status of the required pods, with the exception of the `submariner-addon` pods. 

. Make sure to run the `must-gather` command to collect logs that can help with debugging issues.
