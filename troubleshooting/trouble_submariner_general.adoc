== Resolving the problem: Submariner not connecting after installation - general information

When Submariner does not run correctly after deployment, there are a few troubleshooting steps and resources that you can use to diagnose the problem:

. Check for the following requirements to determine whether the components of Submariner deployed correctly:
+
* The `submariner-addon` pod is running in the `open-cluster-management` namespace of your hub cluster. 

* The following pods are running in the `submariner-operator` namespace of each managed cluster:
+
** submariner-addon
** submariner-gateway
** submariner-routeagent
** submariner-operator
** submariner-globalnet (only if Globalnet is enabled in the ClusterSet)
** submariner-lighthouse-agent
** Submariner-lighthouse-coredns

. Run the `subctl diagnose` command to check the status of the required pods, with the exception of the `submariner-addon` pods. 

. Run the `subctl gather` command on the managed cluster to gather logs of various Submariner pods, with the exception of the `submariner-addon` pods.

. Open an issue. If the other steps do not identify the problem, open an issue with the following information: 
+
.. Run subctl gather to collect all the relevant Submariner logs and add them to the issue.

.. Capture the information for the `submariner` instance of the `ManagedClusterAddon` resource type, and for the `submariner` instance of the `SubmarinerConfig` resource type from the `ManagedCluster` namespace on the hub cluster.

.. Provide the following information in your issue, as well as the other template information:
+
* What happened?
* What you expected to happen?
* How do you reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
* Anything else that we need to know?
* Environment information:
** Submariner version (use the `subctl version` command)
** Kubernetes version (use the `kubectl version` command)
** Diagnose information gathered (use the `subctl diagnose all` command)
** Gather information (use the `subctl gather` command)
** Cloud provider or hardware configuration:
*** OS (use the `cat /etc/os-release` command)
*** Kernel (use the `uname -a` command)
** Install tools
** Other environment information that might be useful
