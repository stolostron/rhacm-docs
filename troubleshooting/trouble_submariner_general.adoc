If you configure Submariner and it does not run correctly, there are some things that you can do to identify the problem and resolve it. 

[#symptom-trouble-submariner-general]
== Symptom: Submariner not connecting after installation - general information

== Identifying the problem: Submariner not connecting after installation - general information

If the network connectivity is not established after deploying Submariner, begin the troubleshooting steps. Note that it might take several minutes for the processes to complete when you deploy Submariner.

== Resolving the problem: Submariner not connecting after installation - general information

When Submariner does not run correctly after deployment, there are a few troubleshooting steps and resources that you can use to diagnose the problem:

. Check for the following requirements to determine whether the components of Submariner deployed correctly:
+
* The `submariner-addon` pod is running in the `open-cluster-management` namespace of your hub cluster. 

* The following pods are running in the `submariner-operator` namespace of each managed cluster:
+
** submariner-addon
** submariner-gateway
** submariner-routeagent
** submariner-operator
** submariner-globalnet (only if Globalnet is enabled in the ClusterSet)
** submariner-lighthouse-agent
** submariner-lighthouse-coredns
** submariner-networkplugin-syncer (only if the specified CNI value is `OVNKubernetes`)
** submariner-metrics-proxy

. Run the `subctl diagnose` command to check the status of the required pods, with the exception of the `submariner-addon` pods. 

. Run the `subctl gather` command on the managed cluster to gather logs of various Submariner pods, with the exception of the `submariner-addon` pods.

. Open an issue. If the other steps do not identify the problem, open an issue with the following information: 
+
.. Run subctl gather to collect all the relevant Submariner logs and add them to the issue.

.. Capture the information for the `submariner` instance of the `ManagedClusterAddon` resource type, and for the `submariner` instance of the `SubmarinerConfig` resource type from the `ManagedCluster` namespace on the hub cluster.

.. Provide the following information in your issue, as well as the other template information:
+
* What happened?
* What you expected to happen?
* How do you reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
* Anything else that we need to know?
* Environment information:
** Submariner version (use the `subctl version` command)
** Kubernetes version (use the `kubectl version` command)
** Diagnose information gathered (use the `subctl diagnose all` command)
** Gather information (use the `subctl gather` command)
** Cloud provider or hardware configuration:
*** OS (use the `cat /etc/os-release` command)
*** Kernel (use the `uname -a` command)
** Install tools
** Other environment information that might be useful
