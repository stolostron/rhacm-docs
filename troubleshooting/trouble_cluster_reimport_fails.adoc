= Reimporting cluster fails on Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management with unknown authority error

If you experience a problem when reimporting a managed cluster to your :product-title-short: hub cluster, follow the procedure to troubleshoot the problem.

[#symptom-cluster-reimport]
== Symptom: Reimporting cluster fails with unknown authority error

After you provision an :ocp-short: cluster with :product-title-short:, reimporting the cluster might fail with a `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` error when you change or add API server certificates to your :ocp-short: cluster.

[#identifying-the-problem-openstack-fails]
== Identifying the problem: Reimporting cluster fails with unknown authority error

After failing to reimport your managed cluster, run the following command to get the import controller log on your :product-title-short: hub cluster:

----
kubectl -n multicluster-engine logs -l app=managedcluster-import-controller-v2 -f
----

If the following error log appears, your managed cluster API server certificates might have changed:

`ERROR	Reconciler error	{"controller": "clusterdeployment-controller", "object": {"name":"awscluster1","namespace":"awscluster1"}, "namespace": "awscluster1", "name": "awscluster1", "reconcileID": "a2cccf24-2547-4e26-95fb-f258a6710d80", "error": "Get \"https://api.awscluster1.dev04.red-chesterfield.com:6443/api?timeout=32s\": x509: certificate signed by unknown authority"}`

To determine if your managed cluster API server certificates have changed, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command to specify your managed cluster name by replacing `<your-managed-cluster-name>` with the name of your managed cluster:
+
----
cluster_name=<your-managed-cluster-name>
----

. Get your managed cluster `kubeconfig` secret name by running the following command:
+
----
kubeconfig_secret_name=$(oc -n ${cluster_name} get clusterdeployments ${cluster_name} -ojsonpath='{.spec.clusterMetadata.adminKubeconfigSecretRef.name}')
----

. Export `kubeconfig` to a new file by running the following commands:
+
----
oc -n ${cluster_name} get secret ${kubeconfig_secret_name} -ojsonpath={.data.kubeconfig} | base64 -d > kubeconfig.old
----
+
----
export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig.old
----

. Get the namespace from your managed cluster with `kubeconfig` by running the following command:
+
----
oc get ns
----

If you receive an error that resembles the following message, your cluster API server ceritificates have been changed and your 'kubeconfig' file is invalid.

`Unable to connect to the server: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

[#resolving-the-problem-openstack-fails]
== Resolving the problem: Reimporting cluster fails with unknown authority error

The managed cluster admin must create a new valid `kubeconfig` file for your managed cluster.

After creating a new `kubeconfig`, run the following commands to update the new `kubeconfig` for your managed cluster:
+
----
cluster_name=<your-managed-cluster-name>
----
+
----
kubeconfig=$(cat <your-new-valid-kubeconfig-file-path> | base64 -w0)
kubeconfig_patch="[{\"op\":\"replace\", \"path\":\"/data/kubeconfig\", \"value\":\"${kubeconfig}\"}]"
kubeconfig_secret_name=$(oc -n ${cluster_name} get clusterdeployments ${cluster_name} -ojsonpath='{.spec.clusterMetadata.adminKubeconfigSecretRef.name}')
----
+
----
oc -n ${cluster_name} patch secrets ${kubeconfig_secret_name} --type='json' -p=${kubeconfig_patch}
----
