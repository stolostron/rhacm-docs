= Troubleshooting application Kubernetes deployment version

A managed cluster with a deprecated Kubernetes `apiVersion` might not be supported.
See the link:https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/[Kubernetes issue] for more details about the deprecated API version.

[#symptom-application-deployment-version]
== Symptom: Application deployment version

If one or more of your application resources in the Subscription YAML file uses the deprecated API, you might receive an error similiar to the following error:

----
failed to install release: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: unable to recognize "": no matches for
kind "Deployment" in version "extensions/v1beta1"
----

Or with new Kubernetes API version in your YAML file named `old.yaml` for instance, you might receive the following error:

----
error: unable to recognize "old.yaml": no matches for kind "Deployment" in version "deployment/v1beta1"
----

== Resolving the problem: Application deployment version

. Update the `apiVersion` in the resource.
For example, if the error displays for _Deployment_ kind in the subscription YAML file, you need to update the `apiVersion` from `extensions/v1beta1` to `apps/v1`.

+
See the following example:

+
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
----

. Verify the available versions by running the following command on the managed cluster:

+
----
kubectl explain <resource>
----

. Check for `VERSION`.
