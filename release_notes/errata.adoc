== Errata 2.10.1

* Fixes a problem that might occur for users who use the {product-title} backup and recovery function and backed up the `managedcluster` namespace without using the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: cluster-activation` label.  The problem caused the managed cluster namespace to remain in the `Terminating` state after it is restored. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-9780[ACM-9780])

* Fixes the issue where a policy might temporarily be set to `noncompliant` with a message of `context cancelled` when the policy was being updated, while the `governance-policy-framework` pod was shutting down on the managed cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10402[ACM-10402])

* Fixes a problem that sometimes caused the console to briefly show a newly created policy as not found before refreshing to the policy details. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10416[ACM-10416])

* Delivers updates to one or more product container images.
