= Errata updates

By default, Errata updates are automatically applied when released. The details are published here when the release is available.

*Important:* For reference, link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/#/[Errata] links and Jira numbers might be added to the content and used internally. Links that require access might not be available for the user. 

FIPS notice: If you do not specify your own ciphers in `spec.ingress.sslCiphers`, then the `multiclusterhub-operator` provides a default list of ciphers. For 2.4, this list includes two ciphers that are _not_ FIPS approved. If you upgrade from a version 2.4.x or earlier and want FIPS compliance, remove the following two ciphers from the `multiclusterhub` resource: `ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305` and `ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305`.

See link:../install/upgrade_hub.adoc#upgrading-by-using-the-operator[Upgrading by using the operator] for more information about upgrades.
