[#permission-to-managed-cluster-monitoring-denied]
== Observatorium API gateway pods in a restored hub cluster might have stale tenant data
//2.9:9681

The Observatorium API gateway pods in a restored hub cluster might contain stale tenant data after a backup and restore procedure because of a Kubernetes limitation. See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#mounted-configmaps-are-updated-automatically[Mounted ConfigMaps are updated automatically] for more about the limitation.

As a result, the Observatorium API and Thanos gateway rejects metrics from collectors, and the {product-title-short} Grafana dashboards do not display data.

See the following errors from the Observatorium API gateway pod logs:

----
level=error name=observatorium caller=logchannel.go:129 msg="failed to forward metrics" returncode="500 Internal Server Error" response="no matching hashring to handle tenant\n"
----

Thanos receives pods logs with the following errors:

----
caller=handler.go:551 level=error component=receive component=receive-handler tenant=xxxx err="no matching hashring to handle tenant" msg="internal server error"
----

See the following procedure to resolve this issue:

. Scale down the `observability-observatorium-api` deployment instances from `N` to `0`.
. Scale up the `observability-observatorium-api` deployment instances from `0` to `N`. 

*Note:* `N` = `2` by default, but might be greater than `2` in some custom configuration environments.

This restarts all Observatorium API gateway pods with the correct tenant information, and the data from collectors start displaying in Grafana in between 5-10 minutes.

[#permission-to-add-denied]
== Permission to add _PrometheusRules_ and _ServiceMonitors_ in _openshift-monitoring_ namespace denied
//2.9:8499

Starting with {product-title-short} 2.9, you must use a label in your defined {product-title-short} hub cluster namespace. The label, `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` causes the Cluster Monitoring Operator to scrape the namespace for metrics. 

When {product-title-short} 2.9 is deployed or an installation is upgraded to 2.9, the {product-title-short} Observability `ServiceMonitors` and `PrometheusRule` resources are no longer present in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace. 


[#lack-of-support-for-proxy-settings]
== Lack of support for proxy settings
//2.9:7118

The Prometheus `AdditionalAlertManagerConfig` resource of the observability add-on does not support proxy settings. You must disable the observability alert forwarding feature. 

Complete the following steps to disable alert forwarding:

. Go to the `MultiClusterObservability` resource.
. Update the `mco-disabling-alerting` parameter value to `true`

The HTTPS proxy with a self-signed CA certificate is not supported. 

[#duplicate-local-clusters-in-kubernetes-service-level-overview-api-server-dashboard]
== Duplicate local-clusters on Service-level Overview dashboard
//2.4:16885

When various hub clusters deploy {product-title-short} observability using the same S3 storage, _duplicate_ `local-clusters` can be detected and displayed within the _Kubernetes/Service-Level Overview/API Server_ dashboard. The duplicate clusters affect the results within the following panels: _Top Clusters_, _Number of clusters that has exceeded the SLO_, and _Number of clusters that are meeting the SLO_. The `local-clusters` are unique clusters associated with the shared S3 storage. To prevent multiple `local-clusters` from displaying within the dashboard, it is recommended for each unique hub cluster to deploy observability with a S3 bucket specifically for the hub cluster.

[#observability-endpoint-operator-fails-to-pull-image]
== Observability endpoint operator fails to pull image
//2.2:9259

The observability endpoint operator fails if you create a pull-secret to deploy to the MultiClusterObservability CustomResource (CR) and there is no pull-secret in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace. When you import a new cluster, or import a Hive cluster that is created with {product-title-short}, you need to manually create a pull-image secret on the managed cluster.

For more information, see link:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#enabling-observability[Enabling observability].

[#missing-data-roks]
== There is no data from ROKS clusters
//2.2.3:12114

{product-title-short} observability does not display data from a ROKS cluster on some panels within built-in dashboards. This is because ROKS does not expose any API server metrics from servers they manage. The following Grafana dashboards contain panels that do not support ROKS clusters: `Kubernetes/API server`, `Kubernetes/Compute Resources/Workload`, `Kubernetes/Compute Resources/Namespace(Workload)`

[#missing-etcd-data-roks]
== There is no etcd data from ROKS clusters
//2.2.3:12114

For ROKS clusters, {product-title-short} observability does not display data in the _etcd_ panel of the dashboard.

[#observability-annotation-query-failed]
== Metrics are unavailable in the Grafana console

* Annotation query failed in the Grafana console: 
// 2.1.0:5625
+
When you search for a specific annotation in the Grafana console, you might receive the following error message due to an expired token: 
+
`"Annotation Query Failed"`
+
Refresh your browser and verify you are logged into your hub cluster.

* Error in _rbac-query-proxy_ pod:
+
Due to unauthorized access to the `managedcluster` resource, you might receive the following error when you query a cluster or project:
+
`no project or cluster found`
+
Check the role permissions and update appropriately. See link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] for more information. 

[#prometheus-data-loss]
== Prometheus data loss on managed clusters
//2.4:17137

By default, Prometheus on OpenShift uses ephemeral storage. Prometheus loses all metrics data whenever it is restarted.

When observability is enabled or disabled on {ocp-short} managed clusters that are managed by {product-title-short}, the observability endpoint operator updates the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` by adding additional alertmanager configuration that restarts the local Prometheus automatically. 

[#error-ingesting-out-of-order-samples]
== Error ingesting out-of-order samples
//2.4:15666

Observability `receive` pods report the following error message:

----
Error on ingesting out-of-order samples
----

The error message means that the time series data sent by a managed cluster, during a metrics collection interval is older than the time series data it sent in the previous collection interval. When this problem happens, data is discarded by the Thanos receivers and this might create a gap in the data shown in Grafana dashboards. If the error is seen frequently, it is recommended to increase the metrics collection interval to a higher value. For example, you can increase the interval to 60 seconds.

The problem is only noticed when the time series interval is set to a lower value, such as 30 seconds. Note, this problem is not seen when the metrics collection interval is set to the default value of 300 seconds.

[#grafana-dev-fails-upgrade]
== Grafana deployment fails after upgrade
//2.6:25815

If you have a `grafana-dev` instance deployed in earlier versions before 2.6, and you upgrade the environment to 2.6, the `grafana-dev` does not work. You must delete the existing `grafana-dev` instance by running the following command:

----
./setup-grafana-dev.sh --clean
----

Recreate the instance with the following command:

----
./setup-grafana-dev.sh --deploy
----

[#klusterlet-addon-search-crashing]
== _klusterlet-addon-search_ pod fails
//2.5:27173

The `klusterlet-addon-search` pod fails because the memory limit is reached. You must update the memory request and limit by customizing the `klusterlet-addon-search` deployment on your managed cluster. Edit the `ManagedclusterAddon` custom resource named `search-collector`, on your hub cluster. Add the following annotations to the `search-collector` and update the memory, `addon.open-cluster-management.io/search_memory_request=512Mi` and `addon.open-cluster-management.io/search_memory_limit=1024Mi`.

For example, if you have a managed cluster named `foobar`, run the following command to change the memory request to `512Mi` and the memory limit to `1024Mi`:

----
oc annotate managedclusteraddon search-collector -n foobar \
addon.open-cluster-management.io/search_memory_request=512Mi \
addon.open-cluster-management.io/search_memory_limit=1024Mi
----

[#hub-self-management-list-grafana]
== Enabling _disableHubSelfManagement_ causes empty list in Grafana dashboard
//2.8:ACM-4942

The Grafana dashboard shows an empty label list if the `disableHubSelfManagement` parameter is set to `true` in the `mulitclusterengine` custom resource. You must set the parameter to `false` or remove the parameter to see the label list. See link:../install/adv_config_install.adoc#disable-hub-self-management[disableHubSelfManagement] for more details.

[#fqdn-not-supported]
=== Endpoint URL cannot have fully qualified domain names (FQDN)
//2.7:ACM-4806

When you use the FQDN or protocol for the `endpoint` parameter, your observability pods are not enabled. The following error message is displayed:

[source,bash]
----
Endpoint url cannot have fully qualified paths
----

Enter the URL without the protocol. Your `endpoint` value must resemble the following URL for your secrets:

[source,bash]
----
endpoint: example.com:443
----

[#grafana-downsampled-mismatch]
=== Grafana downsampled data mismatch
//2.7:ACM-3748

When you attempt to query historical data and there is a discrepancy between the calculated step value and downsampled data, the result is empty. For example, if the calculated step value is `5m` and the downsampled data is in a one-hour interval, data does not appear from Grafana.

This discrepancy occurs because a URL query parameter must be passed through the Thanos Query front-end data source. Afterwards, the URL query can perform additional queries for other downsampling levels when data is missing.

You must manually update the Thanos Query front-end data source configuration. Complete the following steps:

. Go to the Query front-end data source.

. To update your query parameters, click the _Misc_ section.

. From the _Custom query parameters_ field, select *`max_source_resolution=auto`*.

. To verify that the data is displayed, refresh your Grafana page. 

Your query data appears from the Grafana dashboard.

[#metrics-proxy-not-detected]
== Metrics collector does not detect proxy configuration
//2.9:ACM-8488

A proxy configuration in a managed cluster that you configure by using the `addonDeploymentConfig` is not detected by the metrics collector. As a workaround, you can enable the proxy by removing the managed cluster `ManifestWork`. Removing the `ManifestWork` forces the changes in the `addonDeploymentConfig` to be applied.

[#proxy-ca-not-supported]
== HTTPS proxy with a custom CA bundle is not supported
//2.9:ACM-8488

A proxy configuration in a managed cluster does not work when a custom CA bundle is required.
