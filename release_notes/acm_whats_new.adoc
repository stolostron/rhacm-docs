[#whats-new-acm]
= What's new for {acm-short}

{acm} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability. 

*Important:* {acm-short} now supports all providers that are certified through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Kubernetes Conformance Program. Choose a vendor that is recognized by CNFC for your hybrid cloud multicluster management.

See the following information about using CNFC providers:

* Learn how CNFC providers are certified at link:https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/[Certified Kubernetes Conformance]. 

* For Red Hat support information about CNFC third-party providers, see link:https://access.redhat.com/third-party-software-support[Red Hat support with third party components], or link:https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/[Contact Red Hat support].

* If you bring your own CNFC conformance certified cluster, you need to change the {ocp-short} CLI `oc` command to the Kubernetes CLI command, `kubectl`.

//[#installation]
//== Installation no epics this release 2.11;be sure to add bullet up top if that changes

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp-short} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

View tasks and support information at link:../clusters/cluster_mce_overview.adoc#cluster_mce_overview[Cluster lifecycle overview].

[#global-hub-whats-new]
== multicluster global hub 

* You can now have the `local-cluster` enabled on your managed hub clusters by importing your managed hub cluster in hosted mode. See link:../global_hub/global_hub_import_hub_hosted.adoc#global-hub-importing-in-hosted-mode[Importing a managed hub cluster in the hosted mode (Technology Preview)]. 

* For other {global-hub} topics, see link:../global_hub/global_hub_overview.adoc#multicluster-global-hub[multicluster global hub]. 

//[#application-whats-new]
//== Applications

//For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#observability-whats-new]
== Observability

* For more environment stability with default settings, the default CPU request is increased to `500m` and memory request is increased to `1024Mi` for the `thanos-compact` pod. See link:../observability/obs_config.adoc#observability-pod-capacity-requests[Observability pod capacity requests] for more details.

* To create and mount secrets to your `alertmanager` pods for access to arbitrary content, you can add the contents to your `MultiClusterObservability` resource. See link:../observability/observability_alerts.adoc#mount-secrets-alertmanager[Mounting secrets within the Alertmanager pods].

* Grafana is updated to version 11.1.5. See link:../observability/design_grafana.adoc#using-grafana-dashboards[Using Grafana dashboards].

See link:../observability/observe_environments_intro.adoc#observing-environments-intro[Observability service introduction].

[search-whats-new]
=== Search in the console

* You can now view more information about your cluster when you enable the _Fleet view_ switch. The following summary cards are redisigned:

- Cluster
- Application types
- Policies
- Cluster versions

The following new summary cards are available: 

- Cluster version
- Nodes
- Cluster recommendations
- Cluster health
- Personalized view of your resources

See link:../console/console.adoc#home-page[Console overview].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* To configure a cluster based on the available node roles, you can now use the `getNodesWithExactRoles` function to receive a list of nodes, and use the `hasNodesWithExactRoles` function to receive confirmation about clusters that contain nodes with only the roles that you specified. See link:../governance/template_functions.adoc#template-functions[Template functions] for more details.

* You can now define additional health checks and customize status messages for your resource kinds by configuring your `ArgoCD` resource. See link:../gitops/gitops_manage_policy_def.adoc#config-gitops-healthcheck[Configuring policy health checks in {gitops}] for more information.

* To add more clarity for compliance messages in your configuration policies, you can now customize compliance messages by using the `spec.customMessage` fields. See the link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Kubernetes configuration policy controller].

* You can now view the metadata of a root policy by using the `.PolicyMetadata` hub cluster template variable. See the link:../governance/template_support_intro.adoc#template-coomparison-table[Comparison of hub cluster and managed cluster templates].

* You can now use the `hubTemplateOptions.serviceAccountName` field to specify a service account to use for all hub cluster template lookups. See the link:../governance/template_support_intro.adoc#template-coomparison-table[Comparison of hub cluster and managed cluster templates].

* The default value for `spec.evaluationInterval.compliant` and `spec.evaluationInterval.noncompliant` is `watch` to leverage Kubernetes API watches instead of polling the Kubernetes API server. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table] for more information.

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.

[#dr4hub-whats-new]
== Backup and restore

* You can now customize the OADP version by setting an annotation on your `MultiClusterHub` resource. See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_install.adoc#installing-custom-oadp[Installing a custom OADP version].

* You can now use an existing hub cluster as a restore hub cluster by tagging user-created resources on the restore hub cluster with the `velero.io/backup-name: backupName` label. See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/use_existing_hub_cluster.adoc#using-existing-hub[Considerations when using an existing hub cluster as a restore hub cluster] and link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/tag_resources.adoc#tagging-resources[Tagging resources]. 

* You can now temporarily pause the `BackupSchedule` resource instead of deleting it. By using the `BackupSchedule` `paused` property on the backup hub cluster, you can avoid a backup collision. See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_schedule.adoc#avoid-backup-collision[Avoiding backup collisions].

* You can now keep the primary hub cluster active during a restore operation. See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_active_restore.adoc#keep-hub-active-restore[Keeping the primary hub cluster active during a restore process].

To learn about disaster recovery solutions for your hub cluster, see link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_install.adoc#backup-intro[Backup and restore].
