[#certificates-prevent-connection-broker]
=== Self-signed certificates might prevent connection to broker
//2.7:27008

Self-signed certificates on the broker might prevent joined clusters from connecting to the broker. The connection fails with certificate validation errors. You can disable broker certificate validation by setting `InsecureBrokerConnection` to `true` in the relevant `SubmarinerConfig` object. See the following example:
