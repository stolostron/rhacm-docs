[#known-issues-submariner]
== Submariner known issues

See the following known issues and limitations that might occur while using networking features.

[#cluster-management-addon-needed]
=== Without _ClusterManagementAddon_ submariner add-on fails
//2.8:24159

For versions 2.8 and earlier, when you install {product-title-short}, you also deploy the `submariner-addon` component with the Operator Lifecycle Manager. If you did not create a `MultiClusterHub` custom resource, the `submariner-addon` pod sends an error and prevents the operator from installing. 

The following notification occurs because the `ClusterManagementAddon` custom resource definition is missing:

----
graceful termination failed, controllers failed with error: the server could not find the requested resource (post clustermanagementaddons.addon.open-cluster-management.io)
----

The `ClusterManagementAddon` resource is created by the `cluster-manager` deployment, however, this deployment becomes available when the `MultiClusterEngine` components are installed on the cluster. 

If there is not a `MultiClusterEngine` resource that is already available on the cluster when the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource is created,  the `MultiClusterHub` operator deploys the `MultiClusterEngine` instance and the operator that is required, which resolves the previous error.

[#submariner-addon-resources]
=== Submariner add-on resources not cleaned up properly when managed clusters are imported 
//2.9:ACM-8549

If the `submariner-addon` component is set to `false` within `MultiClusterHub` (MCH) operator, then the `submariner-addon` finalizers are not cleaned up properly for the managed cluster resources. Since the finalizers are not cleaned up properly, this prevents the `submariner-addon` component from being disabled within the hub cluster. 

[#not-all-infrastructure]
=== Not all of the infrastructure providers that {product-title-short} can manage are supported

Submariner is not supported with all of the infrastructure providers that {product-title-short} can manage. Refer to the link:{support-matrix}[{product-title-short} support matrix] for a list of supported providers.

[#subm-install-plan]
=== Submariner install plan limitation
//2.9:ACM-8260

The Submariner install plan does not follow the overall install plan settings. Therefore, the operator management screen cannot control the Submariner install plan. By default, Submariner install plans are applied automatically, and the Submariner addon is always updated to the latest available version corresponding to the installed  {product-title-short} version. To change this behavior, you must use a customized Submariner subscription. 

[#headless-services-globalnet]
=== Limited headless services support
//2.5:24159

Service discovery is not supported for headless services without selectors when using Globalnet.

[#submariner-vxlan]
=== Deployments that use VXLAN when NAT is enabled are not supported
//2.5:24258

Only non-NAT deployments support Submariner deployments with the VXLAN cable driver.

[#submariner-ovn-k8]
=== OVN Kubernetes requires OCP 4.11 and later
//2.6:25275

If you are using the OVN Kubernetes CNI network, you need Red Hat OpenShift 4.11 or later.

[#certificates-prevent-connection-broker]
=== Self-signed certificates might prevent connection to broker
//2.7:27008

Self-signed certificates on the broker might prevent joined clusters from connecting to the broker. The connection fails with certificate validation errors. You can disable broker certificate validation by setting `InsecureBrokerConnection` to `true` in the relevant `SubmarinerConfig` object. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: submarineraddon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: SubmarinerConfig
metadata:
   name: submariner
   namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
spec:
   insecureBrokerConnection: true
----

[#submariner-sdn-cni]
=== Submariner only supports OpenShift SDN or OVN Kubernetes
//2.8:ACM-5306

Submariner only supports {ocp} clusters that use the OpenShift SDN or the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

[#submariner-diagnose-azure]
=== Command limitation on Microsoft Azure clusters
//2.8:ACM-5327

The `subctl diagnose firewall inter-cluster` command does not work on Microsoft Azure clusters.

[#submariner-upgrade-limit]
=== Automatic upgrade not working with custom _CatalogSource_ or _Subscription_

Submariner is automatically upgraded when {product-title} is upgraded. The automatic upgrade might fail if you are using a custom `CatalogSource` or `Subscription`.

To make sure automatic upgrades work when installing Submariner on managed clusters, you must set the `spec.subscriptionConfig.channel` field to `stable-0.15` in the `SubmarinerConfig` custom resource for each managed cluster.
