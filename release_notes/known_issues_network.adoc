== Submariner known issues

[#not-all-infrastructure]
=== Not all of the infrastructure providers that {product-title-short} can manage are supported

Submariner is not supported with all of the infrastructure providers that {product-title-short} can manage. Refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7006295[{product-title-short} support matrix] for a list of supported providers.

[#headless-services-globalnet]
=== Limited headless services support
//2.5:24159

Service discovery is not supported for headless services without selectors when using Globalnet.

[#submariner-vxlan]
=== Deployments that use VXLAN when NAT is enabled are not supported
//2.5:24258

Only non-NAT deployments support Submariner deployments with the VXLAN cable driver.

[#submariner-ovn-k8]
=== OVN Kubernetes requires OCP 4.11 and later
//2.6:25275

If you are using the OVN Kubernetes CNI network, you need Red Hat OpenShift 4.11 or later.

[#certificates-prevent-connection-broker]
=== Self-signed certificates might prevent connection to broker
//2.7:27008

Self-signed certificates on the broker might prevent joined clusters from connecting to the broker. The connection fails with certificate validation errors. You can disable broker certificate validation by setting `InsecureBrokerConnection` to `true` in the relevant `SubmarinerConfig` object. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: submarineraddon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: SubmarinerConfig
metadata:
   name: submariner
   namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
spec:
   insecureBrokerConnection: true
----

[#submariner-sdn-cni]
=== Submariner only supports OpenShift SDN or OVN Kubernetes
//2.8:ACM-5306

Submariner only supports {ocp} clusters that use the OpenShift SDN or the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

[#submariner-diagnose-azure]
=== Command limitation on Microsoft Azure clusters
//2.8:ACM-5327

The `subctl diagnose firewall inter-cluster` command does not work on Microsoft Azure clusters.

[#submariner-upgrade-limit]
=== Automatic upgrade not working with custom _CatalogSource_ or _Subscription_

Submariner is automatically upgraded when {product-title} is upgraded. The automatic upgrade might fail if you are using a custom `CatalogSource` or `Subscription`.

To make sure automatic upgrades work when installing Submariner on managed clusters, you must set the `spec.subscriptionConfig.channel` field to `stable-0.15` in the `SubmarinerConfig` custom resource for each managed cluster.
