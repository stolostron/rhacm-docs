Review the known issues for the console. The following list contains known issues for this release, or known issues that continued from the previous release. 

For your {ocp} cluster, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes#ocp-4-12-known-issues[{ocp-short} known issues]. 

For more about deprecations and removals, see http:..release_notes/deprecate_remove.adoc#deprecations-removals[Deprecations and removals] in the release notes.

[#console-message]
== Console access displays _not available_

When you attempt to access the standalone console, you receive the following message: 

`Application is not available: The application is currently not serving requests at this endpoint. It may not have been started or is still starting.` 

You cannot access the console from the `multicloud-console` route because it was removed from {product-title-short} {product-version}. You can access the dynamic plugin version of the console, which is now integrated with the {ocp-short} console. See link:../console/console_access.adoc#accessing-your-console[Accessing your console] for more information.

[#ldap-user-names-are-case-sensitive]
== LDAP user names are case-sensitive
// 1.0.0:before 1.0.0.1

LDAP user names are case-sensitive.
You must use the name exactly the way it is configured in your LDAP directory.

[#console-features-might-not-display-in-firefox-earlier-versions]
== Console features might not display in Firefox earlier version
// 1.0.0:before 1.0.0.1

There are known issues with dark theme styling for older versions of Firefox. Upgrade to the latest version for the best console compatibility.

For more information, see link:../install/requirements.adoc#supported-browsers[Supported browsers].

[#restrictions-for-storage-size-in-searchcustomization]
== Restrictions for storage size in search customization
//2.2:8501

When you update the storage size in the `searchcustomization` CR, the PVC configuration does not change. If you need to update the storage size, update the PVC (`_<storageclassname>-search-redisgraph-0_`) with the following command:
----
oc edit pvc <storageclassname>-search-redisgraph-0
----

[#search-query-issue]
== Search query parsing error
//2.5:22391 

If an environment becomes large and requires more tests for scaling, the search queries can timeout which results in a parsing error message being displayed. This error is displayed after 30 seconds of waiting for a search query.

Extend the timeout time with the following command:

----
kubectl annotate route multicloud-console haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout=Xs
----

[#cannot-edit-namespace-bindings-for-cluster-set]
== Cannot edit namespace bindings for cluster set
//2.6:25389

When you edit namespace bindings for a cluster set with the `admin` role or `bind` role, you might encounter an error that resembles the following message:

`ResourceError: managedclustersetbindings.cluster.open-cluster-management.io "<cluster-set>" is forbidden: User "<user>" cannot create/delete resource "managedclustersetbindings" in API group "cluster.open-cluster-management.io" in the namespace "<namespace>".`

To resolve the issue, make sure you also have permission to create or delete a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource in the namespace you want to bind. The role bindings only allow you to bind the cluster set to the namespace.

[#scrolling-hosted]
== Horizontal scrolling does not work after provisioning hosted control plane cluster
//2.7:27107

After provisioning a hosted control plane cluster, you might not be able to scroll horizontally in the cluster overview of the {product-title-short} console if the `ClusterVersionUpgradeable` parameter is too long. You cannot view the hidden data as a result.

To work around the issue, zoom out by using your browser zoom controls, increase your {product-title-short} console window size, or copy and paste the text to a different location.
