[#search-postgres-crashloopbackoff]
== Search PostgreSQL pod is in CrashLoopBackoff state
//2.9:7467

The `search-postgres` pod is in `CrashLoopBackoff` state. If {product-title-short} is deployed in a cluster with nodes that have the `hugepages` parameter enabled and the `search-postgres` pod gets scheduled in these nodes, then the pod does not start.

Complete the following steps to increase the memory of the `search-postgres` pod:

. Pause the `search-operator` pod with the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc annotate search search-v2-operator search-pause=true
----

. Update the `search-postgres` deployment with a limit for the `hugepages` parameter. Run the following command to set the `hugepages` parameter to `512Mi`:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc patch deployment search-postgres --type json -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/resources/limits/hugepages-2Mi", "value":"512Mi"}]'
----

. Before you verify the memory usage for the pod, make sure your `search-postgres` pod is in the `Running` state. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get pod <your-postgres-pod-name>  -o jsonpath="Status: {.status.phase}"
----

. Run the following command to verify the memory usage of the `search-postgres` pod:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get pod <your-postgres-pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].resources.limits.hugepages-2Mi}'
----

The following value appears, `512Mi`.

[#console-features-might-not-display-in-firefox-earlier-versions]
== Console features might not display in Firefox earlier version
// 1.0.0:before 1.0.0.1

There are known issues with dark theme styling for older versions of Firefox. Upgrade to the latest version for the best console compatibility.

For more information, see link:../install/requirements.adoc#supported-browsers[Supported browsers].

[#restrictions-for-storage-size-in-searchcustomization]
== Restrictions for storage size in search customization
//2.2:8501

When you update the storage size in the `searchcustomization` CR, the PVC configuration does not change. If you need to update the storage size, update the PVC (`_<storageclassname>-search-redisgraph-0_`) with the following command:
----
oc edit pvc <storageclassname>-search-redisgraph-0
----

[#search-query-issue]
== Search query parsing error
//2.5:22391 

If an environment becomes large and requires more tests for scaling, the search queries can timeout which results in a parsing error message being displayed. This error is displayed after 30 seconds of waiting for a search query.

Extend the timeout time with the following command:

----
kubectl annotate route multicloud-console haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout=Xs
----

[#cannot-edit-namespace-bindings-for-cluster-set]
== Cannot edit namespace bindings for cluster set
//2.6:25389

When you edit namespace bindings for a cluster set with the `admin` role or `bind` role, you might encounter an error that resembles the following message:

`ResourceError: managedclustersetbindings.cluster.open-cluster-management.io "<cluster-set>" is forbidden: User "<user>" cannot create/delete resource "managedclustersetbindings" in API group "cluster.open-cluster-management.io" in the namespace "<namespace>".`

To resolve the issue, make sure you also have permission to create or delete a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource in the namespace you want to bind. The role bindings only allow you to bind the cluster set to the namespace.

[#scrolling-hosted]
== Horizontal scrolling does not work after provisioning hosted control plane cluster
//2.7:27107

After provisioning a hosted control plane cluster, you might not be able to scroll horizontally in the cluster overview of the {product-title-short} console if the `ClusterVersionUpgradeable` parameter is too long. You cannot view the hidden data as a result.

To work around the issue, zoom out by using your browser zoom controls, increase your {product-title-short} console window size, or copy and paste the text to a different location.

[#editapplicationset-expand-feature-repeats]
== _EditApplicationSet_ expand feature repeats

When you add multiple label expressions or attempt to enter your cluster selector for your `ApplicationSet`, you might receive the following message repeatedly,  "Expand to enter expression". You can enter your cluster selection despite this issue.
