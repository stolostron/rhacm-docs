[#whats-new]
= What's new in {product-title}

{product-title} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability. 

*Important:* {product-title-short} now supports all providers that are certified through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Kubernetes Conformance Program. Choose a vendor that is recognized by CNFC for your hybrid cloud multicluster management.

See the following information about using CNFC providers:

* Learn how CNFC providers are certified at link:https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/[Certified Kubernetes Conformance]. 

* For Red Hat support information about CNFC third-party providers, see link:https://access.redhat.com/third-party-software-support[Red Hat support with third party components], or link:https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/[Contact Red Hat support].

* If you bring your own CNFC conformance certified cluster, you need to change the {ocp-short} CLI `oc` command to the Kubernetes CLI command, `kubectl`.

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp-short} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

* The documentation for {mce-short} (cluster) is found within the Cluster Lifecycle section of the product documentation.

* View link:../clusters/release_notes/whats_new.adoc[What's new] for {mce-short} 2.6 from _Cluster Lifecycle_, which includes new {mce-short} and {product-title-short} integrated features.

* View tasks and support information at link:../clusters/cluster_mce_overview.adoc#cluster_mce_overview[Cluster lifecycle overview].

[#observability-whats-new]
== Observability

* You can download search results as a CSV file. See link:../observability/manage_search.adoc#querying-in-the-console[Querying in the console].

* Partial matching for search is supported. See link:../observability/search_console.adoc#search-operations[Search operations and data types].

* *Technology Preview:* You can customize the Observatorium API and Alertmanager URLs. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#custom-obervatorium-alert-url[Customizing the managed cluster Observatorium API and Alertmanager URLs].

* You can customize suggested searches in the console to specify the amount of search results that appear. See, link:../observability/manage_search.adoc#customizing-search-console[Customizing the search console]. 

* You can enable the _Fleet_ switch to view the potential risks for updating your managed clusters. See, link:../observability/insights_intro.adoc#update-risks[Viewing update risk predictions]. 

See link:../observability/observe_environments_intro.adoc#observing-environments-intro[Observability service introduction].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* You can now use the `operatorGroup` and `subscription` fields of an operator policy. See link:../governance/template_support_intro.adoc#template-processing[Template processing] for more details.

* Operator policy controller is now in General Availability status. Operator subscription `channel`, `source`, and `sourceNamespace` default values are chosen if you do not specify a value in the fields that are provided. See link:../governance/policy_operator.adoc#policy-operator[Operator policy controller].

* The `mustnothave` mode is now supported by the Operator policy controller. See, link:../governance/policy_operator.adoc#policy-operator[Operator policy controller].

* Use the `recreateOption` field for your configuration policies to delete and recreate an object. See, link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table].

* You can now use the `InStatus` option to store the detected difference of the `ConfigurationPolicy` resource. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table].

* You must now use the new parameter, `upgradeApproval` in your `OperatorPolicy` resource to automate version upgrade approvals for your cluster. See, link:../governance/policy_operator.adoc#policy-operator-yaml-table[Operator policy YAML table].

* Use the new optional parameter, `spec.complianceConfig` to define the compliance behavior for the operator policy. See, link:../governance/policy_operator.adoc#policy-operator-yaml-table[Operator policy YAML table].
