[#installation-whats-new]
== Installation

// potential changes?

[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console

* New navigation --Brandi will add
* **Technology Preview:** You can access Visual Web Terminal from both the navigation and the header. 
// - Visual Web Terminal: keep the updates here (new function only that he wants to highlight) status grid and scrolling
  - Resource details are now availble in a split screen that supports scrolling through the history of the different resource details. See link:../console/vwt.adoc#starting-a-session[Starting a session] for more information.
* You are now directed to the _Applications_ page after you select an application to view from the _Search_ page. See link:../console/search.adoc#search-argo[Query ArgoCD applications] for more information.

[#observability-whats-new]
=== Observing environments

//10937 adding this comment to verify which issue are related to the entries, this comment will be deleted before GA
* {product-title-short} observability service supports 7.4.2 of Grafana. See the link:../observability/observe_environments.adoc#observability-service[Observability service section] to learn more information.

//MJ Note, issue 9124, add a step on how to configure the storage settings in the topic that's referenced
* You can now configure the observability storage size per component. See link:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#creating-the-multiclusterobservability-cr[Creating the MultiClusterObservability CR] for more information.

//Dev issue 11005
* The API storage version for observability is now `v1beta2`. `v1beta2` version retrieves both `v1beta1` and `v1beta2` custom resource definitions.

* You can now add recording rules in the observability service to specify the new metrics, which come from the aggregate query expression. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#adding-custom-metrics[Adding custom metrics] for more information.

* You can now customize the `advanced` configuration in the `MultiClusterObservability` custom resource. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#adding-advanced-config[Adding _advanced_ configuration] for more information.

* You can now remove default metrics. For more information, see link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#removing-default-metrics[Removing default metrics].

* You can now receive information about potential problems in your connected clusters with Red Hat Insights. For more information, see link:../observability/insights_observability.adoc#rh-insights[Observability with Red Hat Insights].

* You can now view the _etcd_ dashboard from the Grafana console. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#viewing-etcd-grafana[Viewing the etcd table].

* You can now identify the metrics that are coming from a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) with the SNO label. See, link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#viewing-and-exploring-data[Viewing and exploring data] for more information.

* You can now use Bring Your Own (BYO) observability certificate authority (CA) certificates. See link:../governance/certificates.adoc#observability-byo-certificates[Bring Your Own (BYO) observability certificate authority (CA) certificates] for more information.

* You can now update the number of replicas for your observability pods. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#updating-replicas[Updating the _multiclusterobservability_ CR replicas from the console] for more information.

* You can now forward alerts from managed clusters to the Alertmanager in the {product-title-short} hub cluster. See link:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#forward-alerts[Forwarding alerts] for more information.

* You can now use the external API for metrics to be queried through the OpenShift route, `rbac-query-proxy`. See link:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#external-metric-query[Using the external metric query] for more information.

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster management

* You can now select your {ocp} version 4.6 or later channel for your cluster upgrades in the {product-title-short} console. The channel selection informs you of available upgrades for your cluster. See link:../clusters/upgrade_cluster.adoc#selecting-a-channel[Selecting a channel] for more information. 

* *Technology Preview:* You can now create cluster pools to better manage your resources and have configured {ocp} clusters available to claim when you need them. See link:../clusters/cluster_pool_manage.adoc#managing-cluster-pools[Managing cluster pools] for more information. 

* *Technology Preview:* You can hibernate certain {ocp-short} managed clusters that are created by {product-title-short} to manage your resources with more flexibility. See link:../clusters/hibernating_a_cluster.adoc#hibernating-a-created-cluster[Hibernating a created cluster] for more information.

* *Technology Preview:* You can now deploy Submariner on your clusters by using the {product-title-short} console. See link:../services/deploy_submariner.adoc#deploying-submariner-console[Deploying Submariner with the console] for more information.

* *Technology Preview:* You can use the `MachinePools` resource to scale your clusters by using the {product-title-short} or the command line. See link:../clusters/scale.adoc#resizing-a-cluster[Resizing a cluster] for more information.
 
* **Technology Preview:** Cluster set???? 

* **Technology Preview:** Discover (brandi to add)

[#application-management]
== Placeholder

* You can now edit the HiveConfig resource directly, and the MultiClusterHub operator does not revert the changes. If the HiveConfig resource is deleted, the MultiClusterHub operator recreates it exactly as it was configured when the MultiClusterHub resource was first created. //Brandi--this is current

[#application-whats-new]
== Application management

* Now if you deploy Argo applications on an {ocp-short} cluster with {product-title-short} installed, you can visualize Argo applications in the Applications table and in the Topology view.

* From the Overview or the Topology overview, you can launch an Argo editor and manage your Argo application. 
You can now select reconcile frequency options: high, medium, low, and off in channel configuration to avoid unnecessary resource reconciliations and therefore prevent overload on subscription operator. See _Reconcile option_ in link:../manage_applications/subscribe_git_resources.adoc#reconcile-frequency[Subscribing Git resources] for more information.

Improvements in the Application management console include a _Commit hash_ and _Tag_, which are specific to Git repository channel type. Additionally, new reconcile inputs are added for both Git and Helm repository types. 

The _Repository reconcile rate_ is added to the console with the default value set as `medium`. If auto-reconcile is disabled, the reconcile option is hidden because the resources will not either merge or replace what is currently reconciled.

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

//updated the name of the section based on issue 11273

* You can now add or include templates in configuration policies. See link:../governance/custom_template.adoc#support-custom-templates-in-config-policies[Support for templates in configuration policies] for more information.

* {product-title-short} now uses {ocp} Service Serving Certificate. For more information, see link:../governance/certificates.adoc#certificates[Certificates].

* You can now create policy violation automations with Ansible Tower. For more information, see link:../governance/ansible_grc.adoc#integrating-governance-ansible[Configuring Ansible Tower for governance].

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
