[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

The documentation for {mce-short} (cluster) is in a different section of the product documentation.

View release notes, as well as tasks and support information at link:../clusters/cluster_mce_overview.adoc#cluster_mce_overview[Cluster lifecycle overview].

[#global-hub-whats-new]
== multicluster global hub 

See the link:../global_hub/global_hub_overview.adoc#multicluster-global-hub[multicluster global hub] documentation for more information. 

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

With the new field, `.status.subscription`, you can see the overall subscription status. Previously, you only had the package status that indicated the status of an individual package. 

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#observability-whats-new]
== Observability

See link:../observability/observe_environments_intro.adoc#observing-environments-intro[Observability service introduction].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* You can now configure the concurrency of the governance framework. See xref:../governance/policy_ctrl_adv_config.adoc#policy-controller-advanced-config[Policy controller advanced configuration] for more details.

* The Gatekeeper operator exposes a setting in the custom resource definition within the `auditFromCache` audit, which is disabled by default. If you enable `auditFromCache`, then you need to set `config.gatekeeper.sh` for the sync details. See link:../governance/create_gatekeeper.adoc#managing-gatekeeper-operator-policies[Managing Gatekeeper operator policies] for details.

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.

[#dr4hub-whats-new]
== Backup and restore

See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_intro.adoc#backup-intro[Backup and restore] to learn about disaster recovery solutions for your hub cluster.
