[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console

* Use the search configurable collection to manage which Kubernetes resources you want to be collected by your hub cluster and managed clusters. For more details, see link:../observability/search.adoc#search-configurable-collection[Search configurable collection].

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Clusters

* The `HypershiftDeployment` CRD and its controller from the `hypershift-preview` technology preview feature are deprecated. The `HypershiftDeployment` CRD and its custom resources remain on the cluster when upgrading to {mce} 2.2, but the remaining `HypershiftDeployment` resources are not reconciled.

* You can no longer use the `HypershiftDeployment` CRD to create a new hosted cluster. Hosted clusters already created with the `HypershiftDeployment` CRD remain on the host cluster after upgrading to {mce} 2.2. 
 
[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

* You can optionally configure the Helm channel type to watch namespace-scoped resources so that any manual changes to those resources are reverted. See link:../applications/config_helm_watch.adoc#helm-watch-config[Configuring Helm to watch namespace resources].

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* You can use the `configurationPolicyAnnotations` parameter in the policy generator configuration to specify key-value pair annotations on generated configuration policies. See link:../governance/policy_generator.adoc#policy-gen-yaml-table[Policy generator configuration reference table] for more details.

* Configure the concurrency of the configuration policy controller for each managed cluster to change how many configuration policies it can evaluate at the same time. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuring-the-configuration-policy-controller[Configuring the configuration policy controller] for more details.

* Clean up resources by using the `pruneObjectBehavior` parameter. See link:../governance/create_policy.adoc#cleaning-up-resources-from-policies[Cleaning up resources that are created by policies]

* Use the `everyEvent` mode to set your governance Ansible automation to run for every policy violation event. See the _Create a policy violation automation from the console_ section in the link:../governance/ansible_grc.adoc#create-a-policy-violation-auto-console[Configuring Ansible Tower for governance].

* Select namespaces by label for the policy controllers by using the `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` parameters. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table] for more information.

* Define file path expressions in the `include` and `exclude` parameters to select namespaces by name. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table] for more details.

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
