You can choose a type of application to create from the Application console `Create application` dorp-down menu. You have the option to create a Git repository, Helm repository, or Object Storage repository Subscription. Subscriptions are Kubernetes resources within channels (source repositories).

*Technical Preview:* From the same drop-down menu, you can now also choose to create an Argo CD ApplicationSet so that you can manage Argo CD Applications across a larger amount of clusters.

With the YAML Editor on, you can see the file update as you create or edit your applications as you modify the fields.

For other Application topics, see link:..//applications/app_management_overview.adoc[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
