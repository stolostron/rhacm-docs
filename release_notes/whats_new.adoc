[#cluster-whats-new]
== Clusters

* Some features of integrating Submariner multicluster networking service through {product-title-short} are generally available. See link:../add-ons/submariner/submariner.adoc#submariner[Submariner multicluster networking and service discovery] for more information. 

* Enable the Globalnet controller to resolve overlapping CIDRs when you enable the Submariner add-on. See link:../add-ons/submariner/submariner.adoc#submariner-globalnet[Globalnet] for more information.

* Host a hub cluster, as well as import and manage clusters on the Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) architecture.

* Central Infrastucture Management now supports Metal3 on the following platforms: bare metal, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, VMware vSphere environments, or when it was installed using the user-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) method and the platform is `None`. 

* You can discover and add hosts to your infrastructure environment during the cluster creation process. See link:../clusters/create_cluster_on_prem.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-premises[Creating a cluster in an on-premises environment] for more information. 

* Use `ManagedClusterSet`, which is now generally available, to manage access to all of the managed clusters in the group together. `ManagedClusterSet` creates a `default` managed cluster set for any managed clusters that are not specifically assigned to a set. See link:../clusters/managedclustersets.adoc[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets] for more information.

* Specify a number of clusters in a cluster pool that are immediately available to claim. See link:../clusters/cluster_pool_scale.adoc#scaling-cluster-pools[Scaling cluster pools] for more information. 

* Use {product-title-short} to create an {ocp-short} cluster on Red Hat Virtualization. See link:../clusters/create_virtualization.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-virtualization[Creating a cluster on Red Hat Virtualization] for more information. 

* Control the placements of your managed clusters and managed cluster sets using taints and tolerations. See link:../clusters/man_clust_taints_tol.adoc#taints-tolerations-manclust[Using taints and tolerations to place managed clusters] for more information.

* Use extensible scheduling to control the placement of your clusters. See link:../clusters/placement_managed.adoc#extensible-scheduling[Extensible scheduling] for more information.

* Learn to recover the backup and restore component by using the `backup-restore-enabled` policy. See link:../clusters/backup_and_restore.adoc#backup-validation-using-a-policy[Backup validation using a policy] for more information.

* Use {product-title-short} discovery to find OpenShift 4 clusters that are available from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_cluster_manager/2022/[OpenShift Cluster Manager]. Discovery is generally available, and the API is updated from `v1alpha1` to `v1`. 

  - After discovery, you can import your clusters to manage. The Discovery service uses the Discover Operator for back-end and console usage. See link:../clusters/discovery_intro.adoc[Discovery service introduction].
 
* You can now specify properties for a disconnected cluster in the credential when you use the {product-title-short} console to create a cluster for VMware vSphere or Red Hat OpenStack Platform. See link:../credentials/credential_vm.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-vmware-vsphere[Creating a credential for VMware vSphere] and link:../credentials/credential_openstack.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-openstack[Creating a credential for Red Hat OpenStack] for more information.

Specify properties for a proxy connecion in the credential. See the credential topic for your infrastructure provider in link:../credentials/credential_intro.adoc#credentials[Managing credentials overview] for more information. 

* The _multicluster engine operator_ is generally available as a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The multicluster engine operator supports {ocp} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp} is a prerequisite for the multicluster engine operator. 

*Technology Preview:* 

See the following cluster features that are available as Technology Preview:

* The `Managed-ServiceAccount` component allows you to create and delete a Service Account on a managed cluster. The component is disabled by default.

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

* The Placement and Placement decisions API is upgraded from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1`. Placements define the target clusters that must subscribe to a `ClusterSet` where subscriptions and application sets are delivered. View these in the console from *Advanced configuration*.

* Access Topology from an individual tab in the single application overview so that you can view everything at the same time. Learn about the Topology from *How to read topology* to learn about each topology element.

* `ApplicationSet` is now generally available as a sub-project of Argo CD that adds multicluster support for Argo CD applications. You can create an `ApplicationSet` from the product console editor. See link:../applications/app_model.adoc#application-model-and-definitions[Application model and definitions].

* Statuses on managed clusters and `subscriptionReports` on the hub cluster are lightweight and more scalable. See the following three types of subsription status reports:

+
- Package-level `SubscriptionStatus`: This is the application package status on the managed cluster with detailed status for all of the resources that are deployed by the application in the `appsub` namespace.
- Cluster-level `SubscriptionReport`: This is the overall status report on all of the applications that are deployed to a particular cluster.
- Application-level `SubscriptionReport`: This is the overall status report on all of the managed clusters to which a particular application is deployed.
+
See link:../applications/subscription_report.adoc#subscription-reports[Subscription reports] for information.  

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
