[#whats-new]
= What's new in {product-title}

{product-title} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability. With this release, you can move towards managing clusters in more environments, GitOps integration for applications, and more. 

Access the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7027073/[Support matrix] to learn about hub cluster and managed cluster requirements and support.

*Important:* Some features and components are identified and released as link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview].

[#installation]
== Installation

* You can now enable or disable the following components by updating the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource: `cluster-permission`, `multicluster-observability`, and `submariner-addon`.

* The `MultiClusterObservability`, `SubmarinerConfig`, and `SubmarinerDiagnoseConfig` tabs are now removed from the _Installed Operators_ page for {product-title-short}. To access the _CustomResources_, go to the _CustomResourceDefinitions_ page and create or update the `CustomResources` property.

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

View release notes, as well as tasks and support information at link:../clusters/cluster_mce_overview.adoc#cluster_mce_overview[Cluster lifecycle overview].

[#global-hub-whats-new]
== multicluster global hub 

* You can import multiple hub clusters and manage them with a single hub cluster. See the link:../global_hub/global_hub_overview.adoc#multicluster-global-hub[multicluster global hub] documentation for more information. 

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

*Technology Preview:* Pull model is in a Technology Preview status, with limited support this release.

* You can use the Argo CD pull model to deploy resources from your hub cluster to each managed cluster with the same `ApplicationSet` custom resource definition that is used for the push model. Pull model implementation applies {ocp} registration, placement, and `manifestWork` APIs so that the hub cluster can use the secure communication channel between the hub cluster and the managed cluster to deploy resources. See the link:../gitops/gitops_overview.adoc#gitops-overview[GitOps overview] for more information.

* You can now go to the topology page to view the `ApplicationSet` applications that were created by using the Argo CD pull model. 

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#observability-whats-new]
== Observability

* The observability component is deployed by the `multiclusterhub-operator`. See link:../observability/observability_arch.adoc#observability-arch[Observability architecture] for more details.

* Use the _Fleet view_ switch from the _Overview_ page header for your Grafana metrics to be displayed, and filter the page data by using cluster labels. See, link:../console/console.adoc#console-overview[Console overview] for more details.

* The following default alerts are provided for the Thanos compactor: `ACMThanosCompactHalted`, `ACMThanosCompactHighCompactionFailures`, `ACMThanosCompactBucketHighOperationFailures`, `ACMThanosCompactHasNotRun`. See link:../observability/observability_arch.adoc#observability-arch[Observability architecture].

See link:../observability/observe_environments_intro.adoc#observing-environments-intro[Observability service introduction].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* You can now increase or reduce the volume of debug logs from the default settings. For more details, see link:../governance/policy_ctrl_adv_config.adoc#configure-debug-log[Configure debug log].

* You can reorder the columns in the policy table. See, the _Governance page_ section in the link:../governance/manage_dashboard.adoc#grc-view[Manage Governance dashboard] topic.

* You can use the `InformOnly` parameter to check the status of Kubernetes objects without enforcing a configuration policy, even if the parent policy `remediationAction` is set to `enforce`. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#kubernetes-configuration-policy-controller[Kubernetes configuration policy controller] to learn more.

* Override the remediation action for your bound policies by using the `bindingOverrides` parameter. You can also use the `subFilter` parameter to select the bound policies. For more information, see link:../governance/policy_overview.adoc#policy-yaml-table[Policy YAML table]. 

* The governance framework supports more template functions from the Sprig library. For more details, see the link:../governance/template_functions.adoc#open-source-community-functions[Supported Sprig open source functions].

* As part of the Red Hat Insights integration with governance, the insights `PolicyReport` now uses the `timestamp` field from the policy that is in violation. For more details, see link:../governance/policy_ctrl_adv_config.adoc.

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.

[#dr4hub-whats-new]
== Backup and restore

See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_intro.adoc#backup-intro[Backup and restore] to learn about disaster recovery solutions for your hub cluster.

* When converting a snapshot to a Persistent Volume Claim with VolSync, there is now a `VolumePopulator` feature that is used to complete the conversion. See link:../business_continuity/volsync/volsync_convert_backup.adoc#volsync-convert-backup-pvc[Converting a replicated image to a usable persistent volume claim] for the updated procedure.
