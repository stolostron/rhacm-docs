[#whats-new]
= What's new in {acm}

{acm} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability. 

*Important:* {acm-short} now supports all providers that are certified through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Kubernetes Conformance Program. Choose a vendor that is recognized by CNFC for your hybrid cloud multicluster management.

See the following information about using CNFC providers:

* Learn how CNFC providers are certified at link:https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/[Certified Kubernetes Conformance]. 

* For Red Hat support information about CNFC third-party providers, see link:https://access.redhat.com/third-party-software-support[Red Hat support with third party components], or link:https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/[Contact Red Hat support].

* If you bring your own CNFC conformance certified cluster, you need to change the {ocp-short} CLI `oc` command to the Kubernetes CLI command, `kubectl`.

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp-short} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

=======

See link:../observability/observe_environments_intro.adoc#observing-environments-intro[Observability service introduction].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* To configure a cluster based on the available node roles, you can now use the `getNodesWithExactRoles` function to receive a list of nodes, and use the `hasNodesWithExactRoles` function to receive confirmation about clusters that contain nodes with only the roles that you specified. See link:../governance/template_functions.adoc#template-functions[Template functions] for more details.

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
