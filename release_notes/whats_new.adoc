[#whats-new]
= What's new in {product-title}

{product-title} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability. With this release, you can move towards managing clusters in more environments, GitOps integration for applications, and more. 

*Important:* Some features and components are identified and released as link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview].

[#installation]
== Installation

You can now rely on the {olm} `operatorcondition` resource to enforce an efficient {product-title} upgrade procedure, which will prevent errors from attempts to skip releases. See link:../install/upgrade_hub.adoc#upgrading[Upgrading] for more details.

[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console

* You can get information about your cluster add-ons from the _Overview_ page. Click *Cluster add-ons* for information about availability and health.

* Grafana component version is upgraded from version 8.1.3 to 8.5.20. Refer to link:../observability/design_grafana.adoc#verifying-observability-version[Verifying observability version].

* When creating a credential, adding an internal certificate authority now automatically updates your `clouds.yaml` with the certificate information.

* The `search-api` and `search_indexer` now expose metrics. Read link:../observability/search_intro.adoc#searching-in-the-console-intro[Searching in the console introduction]. 

* Add multiple environment variables for search pods using the `envVar` section to specify a value for each variable that you name. See link:../observability/search_intro.adoc#search-customization[Search customization and configurations].

* The `prometheus-alertmanager` is upgraded to v0.25.0.

* Thanos is upgraded to v0.31.0
//we don't normally document all the upgrades to the third-party components here, is someone asking to this? Normally it is what we created from the RHACM team and why the user should want to try it out. bcs 5/23

* You can now select multiple nodes to view from the _Utilization_ dashboard.

* Filters and time ranges remain as you navigate through your Grafana dashboards. 

* The following three dashboards are provided when the service is enabled, _Alert Analysis_, _Clusters by Alert_, and _Alerts by Cluster_.

* A new *Remove automation template* option is available on the clusters page.

* You can now receive descriptions, links to Ansible templates, and inventories from the _Automation_ and _Policy Automation_ editor based on your selection.

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

View release notes, as well as tasks and support information at link:../clusters/cluster_mce_overview.adoc#cluster_mce_overview[Cluster lifecycle overview].

* You can now add hosts to an infrastructure environment with iPXE. See link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/scale_hosts_infra_env.adoc#scale-hosts-infrastructure-env[Scaling hosts to an infrastructure environment] for more information.
//this is part of MCE, I believe -- bcs 4/13



[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

* You can use the Argo CD pull model to deploy resources from your hub cluster to each managed cluster with the same `ApplicationSet` CRD that is used for the push model. Pull model implementation applies {ocm} registration, placement, and `manifestWork` APIs so that the hub cluster can use the secure communication channel between the hub cluster and the managed cluster to deploy resources. See link:../applications/gitops_push_pull.adoc#argo-pull-push[Deploying Argo CD with the push and pull model] for more information.

* Configure application placement tolerations to register managed clusters that deploy applications to Red Hat OpenShift GitOps. See link:../applications/gitops_tolerations_config.adoc#tolerations-config[Configuring application placement tolerations for {product-title-short} and OpenShift GitOps] for more details.

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* You can now configure the Policy Generator to remove extra metadata when replicating policies, along with specifying placement label selectors for your policies and policy sets. Read link:../governance/policy_generator.adoc#policy-gen-yaml-table[Policy Generator configuration reference table] for more details.

* Use the `copyConfigMapData` and `copySecretData` functions to copy the data contents of a specific ConfigMap or secret. Read link:../governance/template_functions.adoc#template-functions[Template functions] for more details.

* Add mulitple YAML strings for your policy templates. Read link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table] for more details. 

* You can now create, edit, and display descriptions for your policies by using the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/description` annotation. Read link:../governance/create_policy.adoc#creating-a-cluster-security-policy-from-the-console[Creating a cluster security policy from the console].

* Use the `.ManagedClusterLabels` variable in hub cluster templates to lookup label values from the managed cluster, when the policy is propagated. See the link:../governance/template_support_intro.adoc#template-comparison-table[Comparison of hub cluster and managed cluster templates] section to view the comparison table.

* Leverage the Gatekeeper integration for multicluster distribution and Gatekeeper audit results aggregation on your hub cluster by using {product-title-short} policies. Refer to link:../governance/gatekeeper_policy.adoc#gatekeeper-policy[Integrating gatekeeper constraints and constraint templates].

* You can configure the rate of requests and bursts for the API server to change the responsiveness of the configuration policy controller. Read link:../governance/policy_ctrl_adv_config.adoc#configure-qps-rates[Configure the rate of requests to the API server] for more information.

* Apply the Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus policy set to install Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus. See link:../governance/opp_policyset.adoc#opp-policy-set[Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus policy set] for more detials.

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.

[#add-on-whats-new]
== Add-ons

//This is for 2.8, do not remove | OF | 3Apr23

* You can now replicate a persistent volume by using an Rsync-TLS replication. Rsync-TLS uses a TLS-protected tunnel provided by stunnel for enhanced security. See link:../business_continuity/volsync/volsync_replicate.adoc#rsync-tls-replication-volsync[Configuring an Rsync-TLS replication] for more information.
