//Dev issue 14852:2.4
* You can now view an aggregate of clusters within a fleet for the service-level overview for the Kubernetes API server from the Grafana dashboard. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#viewing-cluster-fleet-service-level-overview-on-k8s-api-server-grafana[Viewing the cluster fleet service-level overview for the Kubernetes API server dashboard].

//Dev issue 15902:2.4
* View the error budget and time remaining within a seven or 30-day period from the Grafana dashboard, where the service can utilize downtime in the cluster service-level overview for the Kubernetes API server. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#viewing-cluster-service-level-overview-on-k8s-api-server-grafana[Viewing the cluster service-level overview for the Kubernetes API server dashboard].

//issue 16743:2.4
* {product-title-short} supports version 8.1.3 of Grafana. See link:../observability/observe_environments.adoc#observing-environments[Observing environments] for more information.

//Dev issue 14851:2.4
* View the cluster service-level overview for the Kubernetes API server from the Grafana dashboard.

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Clusters

* You can now select your {ocp-short} version 4.6 or later channel for your cluster upgrades in the {product-title-short} console. The channel selection informs you of available upgrades for your cluster. See link:../clusters/upgrade_cluster.adoc#selecting-a-channel[Selecting a channel] for more information.

* Updated the cluster creation process with the console with a more intuitive progression. See link:../clusters/create.adoc#creating-a-cluster[Creating a cluster] for more information. 

* You can now edit the HiveConfig resource directly, and the `MultiClusterHub` operator does not revert the changes. If the HiveConfig resource is deleted, the `MultiClusterHub` operator recreates it exactly as it was configured when the `MultiClusterHub` resource was first created.

* Your credentials now update automatically on the managed cluster when you update them on the hub cluster. 

* Create an {ocp-short} managed cluster on the Red Hat OpenStack Platform by using the {product-title-short} console. See link:../clusters/create_openstack.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-openstack[Creating a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform] for more information.  

* You can now import {ocp-short} clusters for management that are hosted on IBM Power systems.

* Added information about managing bare metal assets using `BareMetalAsset` CRs and the {product-title-short} web console. See link:../clusters/bare_assets.adoc#creating-and-modifying-bare-metal-assets[Creating and modifying bare metal assets] for more information.

[#cluster-management-tech-preview]
=== Clusters (Technology Preview)

The following capabilities are _Technology Preview_ this release:

* You can test the ability to host the hub cluster on IBM Power systems.

* You can now group resources in a `ManagedClusterSet` to control the RBAC access permissions for managed clusters, cluster pools, cluster deployments, and cluster claims. See link:../clusters/managedclustersets.adoc/#managedclustersets[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets (Technology Preview)] for more information. 

* Configure `AnsibleJob` Templates to initiate with the installation or upgrade of a managed cluster. See link:../clusters/ansible_config_cluster.adoc#ansible-config-cluster[Configuring Ansible Tower tasks to run on managed clusters] for more information.

* Create cluster pools to better manage your resources and have configured {ocp-short} clusters available to claim when you need them. See link:../clusters/cluster_pool_manage.adoc#managing-cluster-pools[Managing cluster pools] for more information. 

* You can hibernate certain {ocp-short} managed clusters that are created by {product-title-short} to manage your resources with more flexibility. See link:../clusters/hibernating_a_cluster.adoc#hibernating-a-created-cluster[Hibernating a created cluster] for more information.

* You can now configure the Submariner networking service on VMware vSphere and Google Cloud Platform managed clusters. See link:../services/submariner.adoc#submariner[Submariner networking service] for more information.

You can choose a type of application to create from the Application console `Create application` dorp-down menu. From the available options, you can now choose to create an Argo CD ApplicationSet (Technology Preview).

Use the new editor to create an Argo CD ApplicationSet (Technology Preview). Turn the YAML editor on as you can while creating other application types.

For other Application topics, see link:..//applications/app_management_overview.adoc[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance
//section has been cleaned 2.4 what's new
