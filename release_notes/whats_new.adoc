[#whats-new]
= What's new in {product-title}

{product-title} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability. With this release, you can move towards managing clusters in more environments, GitOps integration for applications, and more. 

Access the _Support Matrix_ from the link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes/[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes product information page] to learn about hub cluster and managed cluster requirements and support.

*Important:* Some features and components are identified and released as link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview].

[#installation]
== Installation

* You can now enable or disable the following components by updating the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource, `cluster-permission`, `multicluster-observability`, and `submariner-addon`.

* The `MultiClusterObservability`, `SubmarinerConfig`, and `SubmarinerDiagnoseConfig` tabs are now removed from the Installed Operators page for {product-title-short}. To access the _CustomResources_, the user can access the _CustomResourceDefinitions_ page and create/update the _CustomResources_ property.

[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console


[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

[#global-hub-whats-new]
== Multicluster Global Hub 

//2.9:6449
* You can import multiple hub clusters and manage them with a single hub cluster. See link:../global_hub/global_hub_overview.adoc#multicluster-global-hub[{global-hub-cap}] for more information. 

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

*Technology Preview:* Pull model is in a Technology Preview status, with limited support this release.

//2.9:5868
* You can use the Argo CD pull model to deploy resources from your hub cluster to each managed cluster with the same `ApplicationSet` custom resource definition that is used for the push model. Pull model implementation applies {ocp} registration, placement, and `manifestWork` APIs so that the hub cluster can use the secure communication channel between the hub cluster and the managed cluster to deploy resources. See link:../applications/gitops_push_pull.adoc#argo-pull-push[Deploying Argo CD with the push and pull model] for more information.

//2.9:6830
* You can now go to the topology page to view the `ApplicationSet` applications that were created by using the Argo CD pull model. 

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#observability-whats-new]
== Observability

//2.9:ACM-6677
* The observability component is deployed by the `multiclusterhub-operator`. See link:../observability/observability_arch.adoc#observability-arch[Observability architecture] for more details.

//2.9:6549
* Use the _Fleet view_ switch from the _Overview_ page header for your Grafana metrics to be displayed, and filter the page data by using cluster labels. See, link:../console/console.adoc#console-overview[Console overview] for more details.

//2.9:7362
* The following default alerts are provided for the Thanos compactor: `ACMThanosCompactHalted`, `ACMThanosCompactHighCompactionFailures`, `ACMThanosCompactBucketHighOperationFailures`, `ACMThanosCompactHasNotRun`. See link:../observability/observability_arch.adoc#observability-arch[Observability architecture].

See link:../observability/observe_environments_intro.adoc#observing-environments-intro[Observability service introduction].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

//2.9.8258
* You can now increase or reduce the volume of debug logs from the default settings. For more details, see link:../governance/policy_ctrl_adv_config.adoc#configure-debug-log[Configure debug log].

//2.9:6563
* You can reorder the columns in the policy table. See, the _Governance page_ section in the link:../governance/manage_policy_intro.adoc#grc-view[Manage security policies] topic.

//2.9:6709
* You can use the `InformOnly` parameter to check the status of Kubernetes objects without enforcing a configuration policy, even if the parent policy `remediationAction` is set to `enforce`. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#kubernetes-configuration-policy-controller[Kubernetes configuration policy controller] to learn more.

//2.9:1384
* Override the remediation action for your bound policies by using the `bindingOverrides` parameter. You can also use the `subFilter` parameter to select the bound policies. For more information, see link:../governance/policy_overview.adoc#policy-yaml-table[Policy YAML table]. 

//2.9:7720
* The governance framework supports more template functions from the Sprig library. For more details, see the link:../governance/template_functions.adoc#open-source-community-functions[Supported Sprig open source functions].

//2.9:6921
* As part of the Red Hat Insights integration with governance, the insights `PolicyReport` now uses the `timestamp` field from the policy that is in violation. For more details, see link:../governance/policy_ctrl_adv_config.adoc.

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.

[#add-on-whats-new]
== Add-ons

See link:../add-ons/addon_overview#add-ons-overview[Add-ons overview] for more details.


[#dr4hub-whats-new]
== Backup and restore

See link:../business_continuity/backup_intro.adoc#backup-intro[Backup and restore] to learn about disaster recovery solutions for your hub cluster.

//2.9:6873
* When converting a snapshot to a Persistent Volume Claim with VolSync, there is now a `VolumePopulator` feature that is used to complete the conversion. See link:../business_continuity/volsync/volsync_convert_backup.adoc#volsync-convert-backup-pvc[Converting a replicated image to a usable persistent volume claim] for the updated procedure.
