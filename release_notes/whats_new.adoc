[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console

* You can get information about your cluster add-ons from the _Overview_ page. Click *Cluster add-ons* for information about availability and health.

* Grafana component version is upgraded from version 8.1.3 to 8.5.20. Refer to link:../observability/design_grafana.adoc#verifying-observability-version[Verifying observability version].

* When creating a credential, adding an internal certificate authority now automatically updates your `clouds.yaml` with the certificate information.

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

View release notes, as well as tasks and support information at link:../clusters/cluster_mce_overview.adoc#cluster_mce_overview[Cluster lifecycle overview].

* You can now add hosts to an infrastructure environment with iPXE. See link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/scale_hosts_infra_env.adoc#scale-hosts-infrastructure-env[Scaling hosts to an infrastructure environment] for more information.

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* You can now configure the Policy Generator to remove extra metadata when replicating policies, along with specifying placement label selectors for your policies and policy sets. Read link:../governance/policy_generator.adoc#policy-gen-yaml-table[Policy Generator configuration reference table] for more details.

* Use the `copyConfigMapData` and `copySecretData` functions to copy the data contents of a specific ConfigMap or secret. Read link:../governance/template_functions.adoc#template-functions[Template functions] for more details.

* Add mulitple YAML strings for your policy templates. Read link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table] for more details. 

* You can now create, edit, and display descriptions for your policies by using the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/description` annotation. Read link:../governance/create_policy.adoc#creating-a-cluster-security-policy-from-the-console[Creating a cluster security policy from the console].

* Use the `.ManagedClusterLabels` variable in hub cluster templates to lookup label values from the managed cluster, when the policy is propagated. See the link:../governance/template_support_intro.adoc#template-comparison-table[Comparison of hub cluster and managed cluster templates] section to view the comparison table.

* Leverage the Gatekeeper integration for multicluster distribution and Gatekeeper audit results aggregation on your hub cluster by using policies. Refer to link:../governance/gatekeeper_policy.adoc#gatekeeper-policy[Integrating gatekeeper constraints and constraint templates]

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.

[#add-on-whats-new]
== Add-ons

//This is for 2.8, do not remove | OF | 3Apr23

* You can now replicate a persistent volume by using an Rsync-TLS replication. Rsync-TLS uses a TLS-protected tunnel provided by stunnel for enhanced security. See link:../volsync/add-ons/volsync/volsync_replicate.adoc#rsync-tls-replication-volsync[Configuring an Rsync-TLS replication] for more information.
