[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp-short} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

* The documentation for {mce-short} (cluster) is found within the Cluster Lifecycle section of the product documentation.

* View link:../clusters/release_notes/whats_new.adoc[What's new] for {mce-short} 2.5 from _Cluster Lifecycle_.

* View tasks and support information at link:../clusters/cluster_mce_overview.adoc#cluster_mce_overview[Cluster lifecycle overview].

[#global-hub-whats-new]
== multicluster global hub 

You can use {global-hub} with {product-title-short} backup and restore features. These features give you access to recovery solutions and basic resources. For more information, see link:../global_hub/global_hub_backup.adoc#backup-for-global-hub[Backup for {global-hub}].

For other {global-hub} topics, see link:../global_hub/global_hub_overview.adoc#multicluster-global-hub[multicluster global hub]. 

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

With the new `.status.subscription` field, you can see the overall subscription status instead of package status of only an individual package. 

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#observability-whats-new]
== Observability

* The hub collector metrics are now always collected and sent to the {product-title-short} Thanos instance. When you enable Observability, the service starts an `endpoint-operator` and `metrics-collector` pod in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace on your hub cluster. The `MultiClusterObservability` operator launches and manages the `endpoint-operator` and `metrics-collector` pods. The Observability add-on does not control the pods anymore. See link:../observability/observability_arch.adoc#observability-arch[Observability architecture] to learn more.

* You can use Grafana dashboards to view your hosted control planes cluster capacity estimate, and existing hosted control planes resource utilizations. Hosted control plane observability is part of the cluster lifecycle, or {mce-short},and {product-title-short} integration that you can see from link:../clusters/install_upgrade/acm_integration.adoc#acm-integration[{product-title-short} integration].

See link:../observability/observe_environments_intro.adoc#observing-environments-intro[Observability service introduction].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* *Technology Preview* Enable the policy compliance history API to store and query compliance history events for your hub cluster. See link:../apis/compliancehistory.adoc.json[Policy compliance history API (Technology Preview)]. To enable the API see, link:../governance/compliance_history.adoc#compliance-history[Policy compliance history (Technology Preview)].

* Configure the operations of the Gatekeeper operator webhook to manage admission events. See link:../governance/create_gatekeeper.adoc#managing-gatekeeper-operator-policies[Managing Gatekeeper operator policies] for details.

* Enable the Policy Generator to process Helm charts and add descriptions to policies. See the `policyDefaults.policyLabels` and `policies.policyLabels` optional specifications and more at link:../governance/policy_generator.adoc#policy-gen-yaml-table[Policy Generator configuration reference table].

* You can enable _diff logging_ for `ConfigurationPolicy` resources by using the `recordDiff` parameter in the `ConfigurationPolicy` resource. The difference between the `object-template` and the object on the managed cluster is logged inside the `config-policy-controller` pod on the managed cluster. See link:../governance/policy_ctrl_adv_config.adoc#configure-debug-log[Configure debug log] for details.

* Enable the Policy Generator to process Helm charts and add descriptions to policies. See the link:../governance/policy_generator.adoc#policy-gen-yaml-table[Policy Generator configuration reference table] for more details.

* You can now configure the concurrency of the governance framework. See link:../governance/policy_ctrl_adv_config.adoc#policy-controller-advanced-config[Policy controller advanced configuration] for more details.

* The Gatekeeper operator exposes a setting in the custom resource definition within the `auditFromCache` audit, which is disabled by default. You can enable `auditFromCache`, then set `config.gatekeeper.sh` for the sync details. See link:../governance/create_gatekeeper.adoc#managing-gatekeeper-operator-policies[Managing Gatekeeper operator policies] for details.

* Enable the `auditEventsInvolvedNamespace` to manage which namespace audit event to create, and the `admissionEventsInvolvedNamespace` to to manage which namespace admission event to create. See link:../governance/create_gatekeeper.adoc#managing-gatekeeper-operator-policies[Managing Gatekeeper operator policies].

* *Technology Preview:* You can monitor and install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) operators across your clusters by using the operator policy controller. See link:../governance/policy_operator.adoc#policy-operator[Operator policy controller (Technology Preview)] for more information.

* Use `Placement` resources to define where you want your policies to be placed. See, link:../governance/policy_overview.adoc#policy-overview[Policy overview] for more details.

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.

[#dr4hub-whats-new]
== Backup and restore

* The `backup-restore-enabled` policy includes a new template named, `OADP-channel`. Use the `OADP-channel` template to prevent your backup and restore operator from running with the wrong custom resource definitions. For more details, see link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_validate.adoc[Validating your backup or restore configurations].

* When you enable the backup component on the `MultiClusterHub`, the cluster backup and restore operator Helm chart installs policies. The new `backup-restore-auto-import` informs you about issues with the automatic managed clusters import feature. For more details, see link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_validate.adoc[Validating your backup or restore configurations].   

See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_intro.adoc#backup-intro[Backup and restore] to learn about disaster recovery solutions for your hub cluster.

[#net-whats-new]
== Networking

* You can deploy Submariner on IBM Power Systems Virtual Server. See link:../networking/submariner/deploy_subm_console.adoc#deploying-submariner-console[Deploying Submariner by using the console] to learn more.

* *Technology Preview:* You can also now deploy Submariner on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud. See link:../networking/submariner/deploy_subm_console.adoc#deploying-submariner-console[Deploying Submariner by using the console] to learn more.

See link:../networking/networking_intro.adoc#networking[Networking].
