[#cluster-whats-new]
== Clusters

* You can now select your {ocp} version 4.6 or later channel for your cluster upgrades in the {product-title-short} console. The channel selection informs you of available upgrades for your cluster. See link:../clusters/upgrade_cluster.adoc#selecting-a-channel[Selecting a channel] for more information.

* Updated the cluster creation process with the console to progress more like a wizard. See link:../clusters/create.adoc#creating-a-cluster[Creating a cluster] for more information. 

* Your credentials now update automatically on the managed cluster when you update them on the hub cluster. 

* You can now create a managed cluster from the {product-title-short} console on the Red Hat OpenStack Platform. See link:../create_openstack.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-openstack[Creating a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform] for more information.  

* You can now import {ocp-short} clusters for management that are hosted on IBM Power systems. You can also test out Hosting the hub cluster on IBM Power systems is a Technology Preview function.

* Added information about managing bare metal assets using `BareMetalAsset` CRs and the {product-title-short} web console. See link:../clusters/bare_assets.adoc#creating-and-modifying-bare-metal-assets[Creating and modifying bare metal assets] for more information.

[#cluster-management-tech-preview]
=== Clusters (Technology Preview)

The following capabilities are _Technology Preview_ this release:

* You can test the ability to host the hub cluster on IBM Power systems.

* You can now group recources in a `ManagedClusterSet` to control the RBAC access permissions for managed clusters, cluster pools, cluster deployments, and cluster claims. See link:../clusters/managedclusterset.adoc/#managedclusterset[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets] for more information. 

* You can now configure AnsibleJob Templates to initiate with the installation or upgrade of a managed cluster. See link:../clusters/ansible_config_cluster.adoc##ansible-config-cluster[Configuring Ansible Tower tasks to run on managed clusters] for more information.

* You can now create cluster pools to better manage your resources and have configured {ocp} clusters available to claim when you need them. See link:../clusters/cluster_pool_manage.adoc#managing-cluster-pools[Managing cluster pools] for more information. 

* You can hibernate certain {ocp-short} managed clusters that are created by {product-title-short} to manage your resources with more flexibility. See link:../clusters/hibernating_a_cluster.adoc#hibernating-a-created-cluster[Hibernating a created cluster] for more information.

* You can now configure the Submariner networking service on VMware vSphere and Google Cloud Platform managed clusters. See link:../services/submariner.adoc#submariner[Submariner networking service] for more information. 

* You can now deploy Submariner on your clusters by using the {product-title-short} console. See link:../services/deploy_submariner.adoc#deploying-submariner-console[Deploying Submariner with the console] for more information.

*  You can schedule AnsibleJob templates to run before or after cluster creation or installation by using the console. See link:../clusters/ansible_config_cluster.adoc#ansible-config-cluster[Setting up Ansible Tower tasks with cluster installation and upgrades (Technology Preview)] for more information.

*  You can use the `MachinePools` resource to scale your clusters by using the {product-title-short} or the command line. See link:../clusters/scale.adoc#resizing-a-cluster[Resizing a cluster] for more information.
 
*  You can discover {ocp-short} 4 clusters that are available from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_cluster_manager/2021-02/[OpenShift Cluster Manager]. After discovery, you can import your clusters to manage.

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

* You can now edit the HiveConfig resource directly, and the MultiClusterHub operator does not revert the changes. If the HiveConfig resource is deleted, the MultiClusterHub operator recreates it exactly as it was configured when the MultiClusterHub resource was first created. //Brandi--this is current

* Now if you deploy Argo applications on an {ocp-short} cluster with {product-title-short} installed, you can visualize Argo applications in the Applications table and in the Topology view.

* From the Overview or the Topology overview, you can launch an Argo editor and manage your Argo application. 
You can now select reconcile frequency options: high, medium, low, and off in channel configuration to avoid unnecessary resource reconciliations and therefore prevent overload on subscription operator. See _Reconcile option_ in link:../manage_applications/subscribe_git_resources.adoc#reconcile-frequency[Subscribing Git resources] for more information.

Improvements in the Application management console include a _Commit hash_ and _Tag_, which are specific to Git repository channel type. Additionally, new reconcile inputs are added for both Git and Helm repository types. 

The _Repository reconcile rate_ is added to the console with the default value set as `medium`. If auto-reconcile is disabled, the reconcile option is hidden because the resources will not either merge or replace what is currently reconciled.

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

//updated the name of the section based on issue 11273

* You can now add or include templates in configuration policies. See link:../governance/custom_template.adoc#support-custom-templates-in-config-policies[Support for templates in configuration policies] for more information.

* {product-title-short} now uses {ocp} Service Serving Certificate. For more information, see link:../governance/certificates.adoc#certificates[Certificates].

* You can now create policy violation automations with Ansible Tower. For more information, see link:../governance/ansible_grc.adoc#integrating-governance-ansible[Configuring Ansible Tower for governance].

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
