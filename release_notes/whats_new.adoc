= What's new in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 

{product-title} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability.

* Get an overview of {product-title} from link:../about/welcome.adoc#welcome-to-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes[Welcome to {product-title}].

* See the link:../about/architecture.adoc#multicluster-architecture[Multicluster architecture] topic to learn more about major components of the product.

* The link:../about/quick_start.adoc#getting-started[Getting started] guide references common tasks that get you started, as well as the _Troubleshooting guide_.

[#installation]
== Installation

// 2.2 stuff needed here from Chris

[#web-console]
== Web console

* You can now define the storage settings for search persistence. Persistence is enabled by default with the `searchCustomization` custom resource. For more information, see link:../console/search.adoc#search-in-the-console[Search in the console].

[#observability]
=== Observing environments

* Certificates for observability are now automatically renewed before expiration is met. For more information, see link:../observability/observe_intro.adoc#observability-certificates[Observability certificates].

* The following additional metrics are available with {product-title-short} and are included with telemetry, but are not displayed on the {product-title-short} Observe environments overview dashboard:

  - `visual_web_terminal_sessions_total`

  - `acm_managed_cluster_info` 

* You can now add custom metrics to the observability service, which are collected from managed clusters. For more information, see link:../observability/customize_observe.adoc#adding-custom-metrics[Customizing observability].

* Observability automatically restricts configuration changes for observability resources (`observability-xxx`) in managed clusters to confirm that clusters are in a desired state. This is also applied in the hub cluster. Undesirable updates are reverted. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#customizing-observability[Customizing observability] to learn how to customize the observability service.

* You can now design Grafana dashboards for your cluster. For more details, see link:../observability/design_grafana.adoc#designing-your-grafana-dashboard[Designing your Grafana dashboard].

* OpenShift Container Storage is now a supported storage solution for the observability service. For more information, see link:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#enable-observability[Enable observability service].

To learn more about observability, see link:../observability/observe_intro.adoc#observing-environments[Observing environments].

[#cluster-management]
== Cluster management

// 2.2 stuff here from Chris

[#application-management]
== Application management

You can connect to a private repository using user and access token, which is an improvement in Git connection ability. See link:../manage_applications/configuring_git_channel.adoc#configuring-git-channel[Configuring application channel and subscription for a secure Git connection] for more information.

For all the application management changes and documentation, see link:../manage_applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#security-and-compliance]
== Security and compliance

* You can now install gatekeeper with the {product-title-short} gatekeeper operator policy. See link:../security/create_gatekeeper.adoc#install-gatekeeper-operator-policy[Installing gatekeeper using a gatekeeper operator policy] for more information.

* You can now install the {ocp} compliance operator with the compliance operator policy. See link:../security/compliance_operator_policy.adoc#compliance-operator-policy[Compliance operator policy] for more details.

* You can now create and apply an Essential 8 (E8) scan policy to scan master and worker nodes for compliance with the E8 profiles. For more details, see link:../security/e8_scan_policy.adoc#e8-scan-policy[E8 scan policy].

* You can now rotate internal managed certificates. For more information, see link:../security/certificates.adoc#certificates[Certificates].

See link:../security/grc_intro.adoc#governance-and-risk[Governance and risk] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
