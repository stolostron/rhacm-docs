[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console

* You can now access Grafana through the {ocp-short} route with a URL. See link:../observability/design_grafana.adoc#console-overview[Designing your Grafana dashboard] for more information about the example URL:

+
----
https://grafana-open-cluster-management-observability.{OPENSHIFT_INGRESS_DOMAIN}
----

* You can specify _AnsibleJob_ templates while importing clusters and after creating clusters. See link:../multicluster_engine/ansible_config_cluster.adoc#ansible-template-run-cluster-console[Configuring an _AnsibleJob_ template to run on a cluster by using the console] for more details.

Learn more about the console in the link:../console/console.adoc#console-overview[Console overview].

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Clusters

Cluster lifecycle documentation is now located in link:../multicluster_engine/cluster_lifecycle/cluster_lifecycle_intro.adoc#cluster-overview[The multicluster engine operator cluster lifecycle overview] as documentation for the {mce} operator.

* The _multicluster engine operator_ is generally available as a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The multicluster engine operator supports {ocp} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp} is a prerequisite for the multicluster engine operator.

* The permission cluster set `bind` grants permission to bind the cluster set to a namespace by creating a `ManagedClusterSetBinding`. See link:../multicluster_engine/cluster_lifecycle/managedclustersets_assign_role.adoc#assign-role-clustersets[Assigning users or groups Role-Based Access Control permissions to your ManagedClusterSet] for more details.

* When you create a managed cluster, a `ManagedClusterSet` called `global` is automatically created to ease management. See link:../multicluster_engine/cluster_lifecycle/managedclustersets_intro.adoc#managedclustersets_global[Global ManagedClusterSet] for more details.

* You can add multiple hosts to an infrastructure environment at the same time by selecting the **By uploading a YAML** option. See link:../multicluster_engine/cluster_lifecycle/add_hosts_infra_env.adoc#scale-hosts-infrastructure-env[Adding hosts to an infrastructure environment] for more details.

* The navigation menu option to access the infrastructure environments changed from *Infrastructure environment* to *Host inventory*.

* You can add additional workers to single-node OpenShift clusters created with the Central Infrastructure Management service. See link:../multicluster_engine/cluster_lifecycle/create_cluster_on_prem.adoc#on-prem-creating-your-cluster-with-the-console[Creating your cluster with the console] for more details.
 
[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

* You can optionally configure the Helm channel type to watch namespace-scoped resources so that any manual changes to those resources are reverted. See link:../applications/config_helm_watch.adoc#helm-watch-config[Configuring Helm to watch namespace resources].

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* You can use the `configurationPolicyAnnotations` parameter in the policy generator configuration to specify key-value pair annotations on generated configuration policies. See link:../governance/policy_generator.adoc#policy-gen-yaml-table[Policy generator configuration reference table] for more details.

* Configure the concurrency of the configuration policy controller for each managed cluster to change how many configuration policies it can evaluate at the same time. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuring-the-configuration-policy-controller[Configuring the configuration policy controller] for more details.

* Clean up resources by using the `pruneObjectBehavior` parameter. See link:../governance/create_policy.adoc#cleaning-up-resources-from-policies[Cleaning up resources that are created by policies]

* Use the `everyEvent` mode to set your governance Ansible automation to run for every policy violation event. See the _Create a policy violation automation from the console_ section in the link:../governance/ansible_grc.adoc#create-a-policy-violation-auto-console[Configuring Ansible Tower for governance].

* Select namespaces by label for the policy controllers by using the `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` parameters. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table] for more information.

* Define file path expressions in the `include` and `exclude` parameters to select namespaces by name. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table] for more details.

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
