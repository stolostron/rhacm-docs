* Use the external API for metrics to be queried through the {ocp-short} route, `rbac-query-proxy`. See link:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#external-metric-query[Using the external metric query] for more information.

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Clusters

* You can now select your {ocp-short} version 4.6 or later channel for your cluster upgrades in the {product-title-short} console. The channel selection informs you of available upgrades for your cluster. See link:../clusters/upgrade_cluster.adoc#selecting-a-channel[Selecting a channel] for more information.

* Updated the cluster creation process with the console with a more intuitive progression. See link:../clusters/create.adoc#creating-a-cluster[Creating a cluster] for more information. 

* You can now edit the HiveConfig resource directly, and the `MultiClusterHub` operator does not revert the changes. If the HiveConfig resource is deleted, the `MultiClusterHub` operator recreates it exactly as it was configured when the `MultiClusterHub` resource was first created.

* Your credentials now update automatically on the managed cluster when you update them on the hub cluster. 

* Create an {ocp-short} managed cluster on the Red Hat OpenStack Platform by using the {product-title-short} console. See link:../clusters/create_openstack.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-openstack[Creating a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform] for more information.  

* You can now import {ocp-short} clusters for management that are hosted on IBM Power systems.

* Added information about managing bare metal assets using `BareMetalAsset` CRs and the {product-title-short} web console. See link:../clusters/bare_assets.adoc#creating-and-modifying-bare-metal-assets[Creating and modifying bare metal assets] for more information.

[#cluster-management-tech-preview]
=== Clusters (Technology Preview)

The following capabilities are _Technology Preview_ this release:

* You can test the ability to host the hub cluster on IBM Power systems.

* You can now group resources in a `ManagedClusterSet` to control the RBAC access permissions for managed clusters, cluster pools, cluster deployments, and cluster claims. See link:../clusters/managedclustersets.adoc/#managedclustersets[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets (Technology Preview)] for more information. 

* Configure `AnsibleJob` Templates to initiate with the installation or upgrade of a managed cluster. See link:../clusters/ansible_config_cluster.adoc#ansible-config-cluster[Configuring Ansible Tower tasks to run on managed clusters] for more information.

* Create cluster pools to better manage your resources and have configured {ocp-short} clusters available to claim when you need them. See link:../clusters/cluster_pool_manage.adoc#managing-cluster-pools[Managing cluster pools] for more information. 

* You can hibernate certain {ocp-short} managed clusters that are created by {product-title-short} to manage your resources with more flexibility. See link:../clusters/hibernating_a_cluster.adoc#hibernating-a-created-cluster[Hibernating a created cluster] for more information.

* You can now configure the Submariner networking service on VMware vSphere and Google Cloud Platform managed clusters. See link:../services/submariner.adoc#submariner[Submariner networking service] for more information. 

* You can now deploy Submariner on your clusters by using the {product-title-short} console. See link:../services/deploy_submariner.adoc#deploying-submariner-console[Deploying Submariner with the console] for more information.

* You can use the `MachinePools` resource to scale your clusters by using the {product-title-short} or the command line. See link:../clusters/scale.adoc#resizing-a-cluster[Resizing a cluster] for more information.
 
* Discover {ocp-short} 4 clusters that are now available from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_cluster_manager/2021-02/[OpenShift Cluster Manager]. After discovering clusters, you can import your clusters to manage. See the link:../clusters/discovery_intro.adoc[Discovery service introduction (Technology Preview)] for information.

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

 * You are now directed to the _Applications_ page after you select an application to view from the _Search_ page. See link:../console/search.adoc#search-argo[Query ArgoCD applications] for more information.

* Now if you deploy Argo applications on an {ocp-short} cluster with {product-title-short} installed, you can visualize Argo applications in the _Applications_ table and in the _Topology_ view.

* From the _Overview_ or the _Topology_ overview, you can launch an Argo editor and manage your Argo application. 

* Other improvements to the Application console include a _Commit hash_ and _Tag_, which are specific to the Git repository channel type. Additionally, new reconcile inputs are added for both Git and Helm repository types. 

* You can now select reconcile frequency options: high, medium, low, and off in channel configuration to avoid unnecessary resource reconciliations and prevent overload on subscription operator. See _Reconcile option_ in link:../applications/subscribe_git_resources.adoc#reconcile-frequency[Subscribing Git resources] for more information.

* The _Repository reconcile rate_ is added to the console with the default value set as `medium`. If auto-reconcile is disabled, the reconcile option is hidden because the resources will not either merge or replace what is currently reconciled.

* You can set up subscriptions to subscribe resources that are defined in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) object storage service. See link:../applications/manage_apps_object.adoc[Managing apps with Object storage repositories] for more information.

* From the console, you can view your `ApplicationSet`, which represents Argo applications that are generated from the `ApplicationSet` controller. For information about the Application console, see the link:../applications/app_console.adoc[Application console] overview.

For other Application topics, see link:..//applications/app_management_overview.adoc[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

//updated the name of the section based on issue 11273

* You can now add or include templates in configuration policies. See link:../governance/custom_template.adoc#support-custom-templates-in-config-policies[Support for templates in configuration policies] for more information.

* {product-title-short} now uses {ocp} Service Serving Certificate. For more information, see link:../governance/certificates.adoc#certificates[Certificates].

* You can now create policy violation automations with Ansible Tower. For more information, see link:../governance/ansible_grc.adoc#integrating-governance-ansible[Configuring Ansible Tower for governance].

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
