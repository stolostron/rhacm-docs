[#cluster-whats-new]
== Clusters

*Technical Preview:*

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

You can choose a type of application to create from the Application console `Create application` dorp-down menu. You have the option to create a Git repository, Helm repository, or Object Storage repository Subscription. Subscriptions are Kubernetes resources within channels (source repositories).

*Technical Preview:* From the same drop-down menu, you can now also choose to create an Argo CD ApplicationSet so that you can manage Argo CD Applications across a larger amount of clusters.

With the YAML Editor on, you can see the file update as you create or edit your applications as you modify the fields.

You can now subscribe to a secondary channel if you have a mirrored channel (application source repository). Specify a `secondaryChannel` in the subscription YAML when an application subscription fails to connect to the repository server using the primary channel.

For other Application topics, see link:..//applications/app_management_overview.adoc[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* New columns are displayed from the _Governance_ page. Use the _Source_ column from the console to identify policies that are deployed using GitOps. Use the _Status_ column to verify the enablement of a policy. For more information, see link:../governance/manage_policy_overview.adoc#manage-security-policies[Manage security policies].

* FIPS readiness has been completed for {product-title-short}. For more details, see xref:..release_notes/fips_readiness.adoc#fips-readiness[FIPS readiness].

* Use the integration of Red Hat Insights and governance to send alerts for governance violations. You can also identify which component sent the violation. See link:../governance/grc_insights.adoc#manage-insights[Managing insight PolicyReports] for more information.

* Customize your dashboard with new filtering options that support bulk actions. See link:../governance/manage_policy_overview.adoc#customize-grc-view[Customize the Governance page] for more information.

* Use the `policy_governance_info` metric to view trends and analyze any policy failures. See link:../governance/policy_governance_info.adoc#gov-metric[Governance metric] for more details.

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
