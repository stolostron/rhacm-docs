[#whats-new]
= What's new in {acm}

{acm} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability. 

*Important:* {acm-short} now supports all providers that are certified through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Kubernetes Conformance Program. Choose a vendor that is recognized by CNFC for your hybrid cloud multicluster management.

See the following information about using CNFC providers:

* Learn how CNFC providers are certified at link:https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/[Certified Kubernetes Conformance]. 

* For Red Hat support information about CNFC third-party providers, see link:https://access.redhat.com/third-party-software-support[Red Hat support with third party components], or link:https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/[Contact Red Hat support].

* If you bring your own CNFC conformance certified cluster, you need to change the {ocp-short} CLI `oc` command to the Kubernetes CLI command, `kubectl`.

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp-short} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

* The documentation for {mce-short} (cluster) is in the _Cluster lifecycle_ section of the product documentation.

* View link:../clusters/release_notes/whats_new.adoc[What's new] for {mce-short} 2.6 from _Cluster Lifecycle_, which includes new {mce-short} and {acm-short} integrated features.

* View tasks and support information at link:../clusters/cluster_mce_overview.adoc#cluster_mce_overview[Cluster lifecycle overview].

[#global-hub-whats-new]
== multicluster global hub 

* *Technology Preview:* Enable global search to include resources from all clusters managed by {global-hub}. Global search expands the search capabilities when you use {global-hub} to manage your environment. See link:../global_hub/global_search.adoc#global-search[{global-hub} search (Technology Preview)].

For other {global-hub} topics, see link:../global_hub/global_hub_overview.adoc#multicluster-global-hub[multicluster global hub]. 

//[#application-whats-new]
//== Applications

//For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#observability-whats-new]
== Observability

* You can download search results as a CSV file. See link:../observability/manage_search.adoc#querying-in-the-console[Querying in the console].

* Partial matching for search is supported. See link:../observability/search_console.adoc#search-operations[Search operations and data types].

* *Technology Preview:* You can configure fine-grain role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict metric access. For an example on how to use RBAC, see link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#configure-fine-grain-rbac[Configuring fine-grain RBAC (Technology Preview)].

* *Technology Preview:* You can customize the Observatorium API and Alertmanager URLs. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#custom-obervatorium-alert-url[Customizing the managed cluster Observatorium API and Alertmanager URLs].

* You can customize suggested searches in the console to specify the amount of search results that appear. See link:../observability/manage_search.adoc#customizing-search-console[Customizing the search console]. 

* You can enable the _Fleet_ switch to view the potential risks for updating your managed clusters. See link:../observability/insights_intro.adoc#update-risks[Viewing update risk predictions]. 

* You can now view the {ocp-virt} dashboard to see detailed insights for each cluster with the {ocp-virt-short} operator installed. See link:../observability/use_observability.adoc#viewing-ocpvirt-dashboards[Viewing the {ocp-virt-short} dashboard].

See link:../observability/observe_environments_intro.adoc#observing-environments-intro[Observability service introduction].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* You can now use the `operatorGroup` and `subscription` fields of an operator policy. See link:../governance/template_support_intro.adoc#template-processing[Template processing] for more details.

* Operator policy controller is now in General Availability status. Operator subscription `channel`, `source`, and `sourceNamespace` default values are chosen if you do not specify a value in the fields that are provided. See link:../governance/policy_operator.adoc#policy-operator[Operator policy controller].

* Operator policy controller now supports the `mustnothave` mode. See link:../governance/policy_operator.adoc#policy-operator[Operator policy controller].

* Use the `recreateOption` field for your configuration policies to delete and recreate an object. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table].

* You can now use the `InStatus` option to store the detected difference of the `ConfigurationPolicy` resource. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table].

* Use the new `upgradeApproval` parameter in your `OperatorPolicy` resource to automate version upgrade approvals for your cluster. See link:../governance/policy_operator.adoc#policy-operator-yaml-table[Operator policy YAML table].

* Use the new optional `spec.complianceConfig` parameter to define the compliance behavior for the operator policy. See link:../governance/policy_operator.adoc#policy-operator-yaml-table[Operator policy YAML table].

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.

[#dr4hub-whats-new]
== Backup and restore

* You can now customize the OADP version by setting an annotation on your `MultiClusterHub` resource. See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_install.adoc#installing-custom-oadp[Installing a custom OADP version].

* You can now use an existing hub cluster as a restore hub cluster by tagging user-created resources on the restore hub cluster with the `velero.io/backup-name: backupName` label. See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/use_existing_hub_cluster.adoc#using-existing-hub[Considerations when using an existing hub cluster as a restore hub cluster] and link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/tag_resources.adoc#tagging-resources[Tagging resources]. 

* You can now enable the backup component on the `MultiClusterHub` so that the cluster backup and restore operator Helm chart can automatically install the OADP operator in the `open-cluster-management-backup` namespace. See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_validate.adoc#backup-validation-using-a-policy[Validating your backup or restore configurations].

* When you install the OADP operator, the Velero custom resource definitions are installed on the hub cluster and are no longer updated by the `MultiClusterHub` resource. See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_intro.adoc#installing-the-oadp-operator[Installing the OADP operator]. 

* To learn about disaster recovery solutions for your hub cluster, see link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_install.adoc#backup-intro[Backup and restore].
