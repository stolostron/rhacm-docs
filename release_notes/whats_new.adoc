[#installation]
== Installation

* You can now enable or disable the following components by updating the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource, `cluster-permission`, `multicluster-observability`, and `submariner-addon`.

* The `MultiClusterObservability`, `SubmarinerConfig`, and `SubmarinerDiagnoseConfig` tabs are now removed from the Installed Operators page for {product-title-short}. To access the _CustomResources_, the user can access the _CustomResourceDefinitions_ page and create/update the _CustomResources_ property.

[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console
//team said nothing new this release, if that is the case, we can remove any section with no updates

//2.9:ACM-6677
* The observability component is deployed by the `multiclusterhub-operator`. See link:../observability/observability_arch.adoc#observability-arch[Observability architecture] for more details.

//2.9:6549
* Use the _Beta view_ switch from the _Overview_ page header for your Grafana metrics to be displayed, and filter the page data by using cluster labels. See, link:../console/console.adoc#console-overview[Console overview] for more details.

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

View release notes, as well as tasks and support information at link:../clusters/cluster_mce_overview.adoc#cluster_mce_overview[Cluster lifecycle overview].

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

*Technology Preview:* Pull model is in a Technology Preview status, with limited support this release.

//2.9:5868
* You can use the Argo CD pull model to deploy resources from your hub cluster to each managed cluster with the same `ApplicationSet` custom resource definition that is used for the push model. Pull model implementation applies {ocp} registration, placement, and `manifestWork` APIs so that the hub cluster can use the secure communication channel between the hub cluster and the managed cluster to deploy resources. See link:../applications/gitops_push_pull.adoc#argo-pull-push[Deploying Argo CD with the push and pull model] for more information.

//2.9:6830
* You can now go to the topology page to view the `ApplicationSet` applications that were created by using the Argo CD pull model. 

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

//2.9:6563
* You can reorder the columns in the policy table. See, the _Governance page_ section in the link:../governance/manage_policy_intro.adoc#grc-view[Manage security policies] topic.

//2.9:6709
* You can use the `InformOnly` parameter to check the status of Kubernetes objects without enforcing a configuration policy, even if the parent policy `remediationAction` is set to `enforce`. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#kubernetes-configuration-policy-controller[Kubernetes configuration policy controller] to learn more.

//2.9:1384
* Overrides the remediation action for your bound policies by using the `bindingOverrides` parameter. For more information, see link:../governance/policy_overview.adoc#policy-yaml-table[Policy YAML table]. 

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
