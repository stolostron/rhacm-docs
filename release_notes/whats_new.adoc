[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console

The changes to the side-bar navigation align with other products and offer a better user experience. From the navigation, you can access various product features. 

[#observability-whats-new]
=== Observability

* Add recording rules in the observability service to calculate the Kubernetes API server service-level indicator (SLI) and service-level objective (SLO). For more details, see link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#creating-custom-rules[Creating custom rules].

* You can now view an aggregate of clusters within a fleet for the service-level overview for the Kubernetes API server from the Grafana dashboard. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#viewing-cluster-fleet-service-level-overview-on-k8s-api-server-grafana[Viewing the cluster fleet service-level overview for the Kubernetes API server dashboard].

* View the error budget and time remaining within a seven or 30-day period from the Grafana dashboard, where the service can utilize downtime in the cluster service-level overview for the Kubernetes API server. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#viewing-cluster-service-level-overview-on-k8s-api-server-grafana[Viewing the cluster service-level overview for the Kubernetes API server dashboard].

* Use {product-title-short} with Grafana 8.1.3 to view metrics. See link:../observability/observe_environments.adoc#observing-environments[Observing environments] for more information.

* View the cluster service-level overview for the Kubernetes API server from the Grafana dashboard. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#viewing-cluster-service-level-overview-on-k8s-api-server-grafana[Viewing the cluster service-level overview for the Kubernetes API server dashboard].

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Clusters

* You can now host {ocp-short} hub clusters on the following platforms, as well as manage clusters that are provisioned on these platforms:
** IBM Z and LinuxONE
** IBM Power systems

* Create and manage a Microsoft Azure Government cluster using the {product-title-short} console. See link:../credentials/credential_azure.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-microsoft-azure[Creating a credential for Microsoft Azure] for more information. 

* Create infrastructure environments to manage your on-premises clusters. See link:../clusters/create_infra_env.adoc#creating-an-infrastructure-environment[Creating an infrastructure environment] for more information.  

* Create on-premises clusters in an infrastructure environment with the {product-title-short} console. See link:../clusters/create_cluster_on_prem.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-premises[Creating a cluster in an on-premises environment] for more information. 

* Select your managed clusters based on the status of the add-ons. See link:../clusters/placement_managed.adoc#addon-status[Add-on status] for more information.

* You can now configure the proxy information for your cluster with the {product-title-short} console when you create a cluster. See the creation topic of the cluster that you are creating in link:../clusters/create.adoc#creating-a-cluster[Creating a cluster] for more information.   

*Technology Preview:*

* Use the cluster backup and restore operator to schedule back up and restore for your cluster resources. See link:../clusters/backup_and_restore.adoc#hub-backup-and-restore[Cluster backup and restore operator (Technology Preview)] for more information.

* Deploy multiple SNO clusters using zero touch provisioning. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/scalability_and_performance/ztp-deploying-disconnected[Deploying distributed units at scale in a disconnected environment] in the {ocp-short} documentation for more information. 

* Replicate persistent volume using VolSync, which enables you to create copies of the data on a persistent volume. See link:../clusters/volsync.adoc#volsync[Replicating persistent volumes with VolSync] for more information. 

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

Choose a type of application to create from the Application console `Create application` drop-down menu. You have the option to create a Git repository, Helm repository, or Object Storage repository Subscription. Subscriptions are Kubernetes resources within channels (source repositories).

*Technology Preview:* You can now also choose to create an Argo CD ApplicationSet from the same drop-down menu so that you can manage Argo CD Applications across a larger amount of clusters.

With the YAML Editor on, you can see the file update as you create or edit your applications as you modify the fields.

You can specify the secondary channel when you create an application, or after. When you create the secondary channel, the application uses the secondary when the primary fails.

As a subscription administrator, you can create an allow and deny list. In the same role, you can also now deploy all application resources into the subscription namespace. See link:../applications/app_advanced_config.adoc#application-advanced-configuration[Application advanced configuration] for more information about subscription administrator tasks and other advanced configuration topics.

For other Application topics, see link:..//applications/app_management_overview.adoc[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

//2.5:17904
* Use the optional YAML field, `metadataComplianceType`, to process labels and annotations of an object differently than the other fields. For more information, see the link:../apis/policy.adoc#policy-api[Policy API].

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
