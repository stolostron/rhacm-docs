[#whats-new]
= What's new in {product-title}

{product-title} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability. With this release, you can move towards managing clusters in more environments, GitOps integration for applications, and more. 

*Important:* Some features and components are identified and released as link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview].

[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console
//stand alone console went away

* Use the search configurable collection to manage which Kubernetes resources you want to be collected by your hub cluster and managed clusters. For more details, see link:../observability/search.adoc#search-configurable-collection[Search configurable collection].

* Collect user-defined metrics using {ocp-short} monitoring. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#adding-user-workload-metrics[Adding user workload metrics] for more details.

* You can now use managed cluster label in Grafana. See link:../observability/design_grafana.adoc#using-managed-cluster-labels[Using managed cluster labels in Grafana].

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle documentation is documentated for within the {mce}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. 

The {mce-short} supports {ocp} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp} is a prerequisite for the multicluster engine operator, while {product-title-short} is not.

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

Now you can use `LeaderElection` to change how controllers make requests to choose a new leader in case of a failure, which ensures only one leader instance handles the reconciliation at a time. You can increase or decrease the amount of time a controller takes to acquire `LeaderElection`. See link:../applications/config_leader_election.adoc#config_leader_election[Configuring leader election].

You can now launch an {aap-short} Workflow by using the `AnsibleJob` custom resource. Replace the `job_template_name` field with the `workflow_template_name` to track a set of jobs. See  link:../applications/ansible_config.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring {aap-short}].

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* You can receive policy violation details from your automation. See link:../governance/manage_policy_intro.adoc#grc-automation-configuration[Governance automation configuration].
 
* Logs are now differentiated by policy controller name with the `ManagedClusterAddOn` resource. See link:../governance/policy_ctrl_adv_config.adoc#configure-debug-log[Configure debug log].
 
* The policy framework now supports activating policy or policy templates using dependencies. See link:../governance/policy_dependencies.adoc#policy-dependencies[Policy dependencies].

* Policy generator now references local and remote Kustomize configurations for enhanced flexibility. See link:../governance/policy_generator.adoc#policy-generator[Policy generator] for more details.

* Configure your hub cluster templates to automatically reconcile template processing. For example, sync secrets and other resources from the hub cluster to managed clusters. See link:../governance/custom_template_functions.adoc#special-annotation-processing[Special annotation for reprocessing].

* Use the `toLiteral` function to remove any quotation marks around a template string after it is processed. See link:../governance/custom_template_functions.adoc#toliteral-function[_toLiteral_ function] for more details.

* You can manage policy definitions with OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD). See link:../governance/manage_policy_def.adoc#manage-policy-definitions[Managing policy definitions with OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)].

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.

[#add-on-whats-new]
== Add-ons

* The restic and rclone movers now run as non-root by default and do not have SE Linux capabilities anymore. The mover pods for restic and rclone do not require elevating permissions on the namespace if Pod Security Standards require that pods in the namespace run with restricted permissions.

* You can use the new Submariner `LoadBalancer` mode that simplifies the deployment of Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters and Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS  clusters. See link:../add-ons/submariner/deploy_subm_manual.adoc#preparing-aro-console[Preparing Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift for Submariner by using the console (Technology Preview)] and link:../add-ons/submariner/deploy_subm_manual.adoc#preparing-rosa-console[Preparing Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS for Submariner by using the console (Technology Preview)] for more information.

* Submariner now supports disconnected clusters so that you can reduce security concerns. See link:../add-ons/submariner/subm_disconnected.adoc#deploying-submariner-disconnected[Deploying Submariner on disconnected clusters] for more information.

[#dr4hub-whats-new]
== Backup and restore

* You can automatically connect imported clusters to the new hub cluster by using the Managed Service Account component. See link:../backup_restore/manage_backup_restore.adoc#auto-connect-clusters-msa[Automatically connecting clusters by using a Managed Service Account (Technology Preview)] for more details.
