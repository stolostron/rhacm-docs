[#whats-new]
= What's new in {acm}

{acm} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability. 

*Important:* {acm-short} now supports all providers that are certified through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Kubernetes Conformance Program. Choose a vendor that is recognized by CNFC for your hybrid cloud multicluster management.

See the following information about using CNFC providers:

* Learn how CNFC providers are certified at link:https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/[Certified Kubernetes Conformance]. 

* For Red Hat support information about CNFC third-party providers, see link:https://access.redhat.com/third-party-software-support[Red Hat support with third party components], or link:https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/[Contact Red Hat support].

* If you bring your own CNFC conformance certified cluster, you need to change the {ocp-short} CLI `oc` command to the Kubernetes CLI command, `kubectl`.

//[#installation]
//== Installation no epics this release 2.11;be sure to add bullet up top if that changes

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp-short} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

[#global-hub-whats-new]
== multicluster global hub 

For other {global-hub} topics, see link:../global_hub/global_hub_overview.adoc#multicluster-global-hub[multicluster global hub]. 


//[#application-whats-new]
//== Applications

//For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#observability-whats-new]
== Observability

See link:../observability/observe_environments_intro.adoc#observing-environments-intro[Observability service introduction].

[search-whats-new]
=== Search in the console

* You can now view more information about your cluster when you enable the _Fleet view_ switch. The following summary cards are redisigned:

- Cluster
- Application types
- Policies
- Cluster versions

The following new summary cards are available: 

- Cluster version
- Nodes
- Cluster recommendations
- Cluster health
- Personalized view of your resources

See link:../console/console.adoc#home-page[Console overview].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* To configure a cluster based on the available node roles, you can now use the `getNodesWithExactRoles` function to receive a list of nodes, and use the `hasNodesWithExactRoles` function to receive confirmation about clusters that contain nodes with only the roles that you specified. See link:../governance/template_functions.adoc#template-functions[Template functions] for more details.

* You can now define additional health checks and customize status messages for your resource kinds by configuring your `ArgoCD` resource. See link:../gitops/gitops_manage_policy_def.adoc#config-gitops-healthcheck[Configuring policy health checks in {ocp-short} GitOps (Argo CD)] for more information.

* To add more clarity for compliance messages in your configuration policies, you can now customize compliance messages by using the `spec.customMessage` fields. See the link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Kubernetes configuration policy controller].

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.

[#dr4hub-whats-new]
== Backup and restore

* You can now temporarily pause the `BackupSchedule` resource instead of deleting it. By using the `BackupSchedule` `paused` property on the backup hub cluster, you can avoid a backup collision. See link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_schedule.adoc#avoid-backup-collision[Avoiding backup collisions].

To learn about disaster recovery solutions for your hub cluster, see link:../business_continuity/backup_restore/backup_install.adoc#backup-intro[Backup and restore].
