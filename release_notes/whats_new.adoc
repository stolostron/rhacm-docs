[#whats-new]
= What's new in {product-title}

{product-title} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability. 

*Important:* {product-title-short} now supports all providers that are certified through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Kubernetes Conformance Program. Choose a vendor that is recognized by CNFC for your hybrid cloud multicluster management.

See the following information about using CNFC providers:

* Learn how CNFC providers are certified at link:https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/[Certified Kubernetes Conformance]. 

* For Red Hat support information about CNFC third-party providers, see link:https://access.redhat.com/third-party-software-support[Red Hat support with third party components], or link:https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/[Contact Red Hat support].

* If you bring your own CNFC conformance certified cluster, you need to change the {ocp-short} CLI `oc` command to the Kubernetes CLI command, `kubectl`.

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Cluster 

Cluster lifecycle components and features are within the {mce-short}, which is a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The {mce-short} supports {ocp-short} and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. {ocp-short} is a prerequisite for this technology.

* The documentation for {mce-short} (cluster) is found within the Cluster Lifecycle section of the product documentation.

* View link:../clusters/release_notes/whats_new.adoc[What's new] for {mce-short} 2.6 from _Cluster Lifecycle_, which includes new {mce-short} and {product-title-short} integrated features.
