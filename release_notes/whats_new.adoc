[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console
//stand alone console went away

* Use the search configurable collection to manage which Kubernetes resources you want to be collected by your hub cluster and managed clusters. For more details, see link:../observability/search.adoc#search-configurable-collection[Search configurable collection].

* Collect user-defined metrics using {ocp-short} monitoring. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#adding-user-workload-metrics[Adding user workload metrics] for more details.

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

Now you can use `LeaderElection` to change how controllers make requests to choose a new leader in case of a failure, which ensures only one leader instance handles the reconciliation at a time. You can increase or decrease the amount of time a controller takes to acquire `LeaderElection`. See link:../applications/config_leader_election.adoc#config_leader_election[Configuring leader election].

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* You can use the `configurationPolicyAnnotations` parameter in the policy generator configuration to specify key-value pair annotations on generated configuration policies. See link:../governance/policy_generator.adoc#policy-gen-yaml-table[Policy generator configuration reference table] for more details.

* Configure the concurrency of the configuration policy controller for each managed cluster to change how many configuration policies it can evaluate at the same time. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuring-the-configuration-policy-controller[Configuring the configuration policy controller] for more details.

* Clean up resources by using the `pruneObjectBehavior` parameter. See link:../governance/create_policy.adoc#cleaning-up-resources-from-policies[Cleaning up resources that are created by policies]

* Use the `everyEvent` mode to set your governance Ansible automation to run for every policy violation event. See the _Create a policy violation automation from the console_ section in the link:../governance/ansible_grc.adoc#create-a-policy-violation-auto-console[Configuring Ansible Tower for governance].

* Select namespaces by label for the policy controllers by using the `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` parameters. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table] for more information.

* Define file path expressions in the `include` and `exclude` parameters to select namespaces by name. See link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configuration-policy-yaml-table[Configuration policy YAML table] for more details.

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.

[#add-on-whats-new]
== Add-ons

To see more release note topics, go to the xref:../release_notes/release_notes.adoc#red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes-release-notes[Release notes].

* The VolSync operator is now generally available for for copying persistent volume claims with {product-title-short}. See link:../add-ons/volsync/volsync.adoc#volsync[VolSync persistent volume replication service] for more information. 

* The restic and rclone movers now run as non-root by default and do not have SE Linux capabilities anymore. The movers previously ran with a service account that used an elevated SCC in order to run as root with enhanced capabilities. This means the mover pods for restic and rclone will not require elevating permissions on the namespace if Pod Security Standards require that pods in the namespace run with restricted permissions.

* Submariner has a new `LoadBalancer` mode that simplifies the deployment of Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters and Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) clusters. See link:../add-ons/submariner/submariner_prepare_hosts.adoc#preparing-aro[Preparing Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift for Submariner (Technology Preview)] and link:../add-ons/submariner/submariner_prepare_hosts.adoc#preparing-rosa[Preparing Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS for Submariner (Technology Preview)] for more information.

[#dr4hub-whats-new]
== Backup and restore

* You can automatically connect imported clusters to the new hub cluster by using the Managed Service Account component. See link:../backup_restore/manage_backup_restore.adoc#auto-connect-clusters-msa[Automatically connecting clusters by using a Managed Service Account (Technology Preview)] for more details.
