[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

*Technology Preview:* Pull model is in a Technology Preview status, with limited support this release.

* You can use the Argo CD pull model to deploy resources from your hub cluster to each managed cluster with the same `ApplicationSet` CRD that is used for the push model. Pull model implementation applies {ocm} registration, placement, and `manifestWork` APIs so that the hub cluster can use the secure communication channel between the hub cluster and the managed cluster to deploy resources. See link:../applications/gitops_push_pull.adoc#argo-pull-push[Deploying Argo CD with the push and pull model] for more information.

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].
