[#whats-new-in-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes]
= What's new in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 

{product-title} provides visibility of your entire Kubernetes domain with built-in governance, cluster lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management, along with observability.

* Get an overview of {product-title} from link:../about/welcome.adoc#welcome-to-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes[Welcome to {product-title}].

* See the link:../about/architecture.adoc#multicluster-architecture[Multicluster architecture] topic to learn more about major components of the product.

* The link:../about/quick_start.adoc#getting-started[Getting started] guide references common tasks that get you started, as well as the _Troubleshooting guide_.

[#installation]
== Installation

* You can now install your hub cluster in the Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated environment. For more information, see Support for installing the hub cluster and managed clusters in the Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated environment. For more information, see link:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online[Installing while connected online].

* You can install the {product-title-short} hub cluster on infrastructure nodes. For more information, see link:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online[Installing while connected online].

[#web-console]
== Web console

* You can now define the storage settings for search persistence. Persistence is enabled by default with the `searchCustomization` custom resource. For more information, see link:../console/search.adoc#search-in-the-console[Search in the console].

[#observability]
=== Observing environments

* Certificates for observability are now automatically renewed before expiration is met. For more information, see link:../observability/observe_intro.adoc#observability-certificates[Observability certificates].

* The following additional metrics are available with {product-title-short} and are included with telemetry, but are not displayed on the {product-title-short} Observe environments overview dashboard:

  - `visual_web_terminal_sessions_total`

  - `acm_managed_cluster_info` 

* You can now add custom metrics to the observability service, which are collected from managed clusters. For more information, see link:../observability/customize_observe.adoc#adding-custom-metrics[Customizing observability].

* Observability automatically restricts configuration changes for observability resources (`observability-xxx`) in managed clusters to confirm that clusters are in a desired state. This is also applied in the hub cluster. Undesirable updates are reverted. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#customizing-observability[Customizing observability] to learn how to customize the observability service.

* You can now design Grafana dashboards for your cluster. For more details, see link:../observability/design_grafana.adoc#designing-your-grafana-dashboard[Designing your Grafana dashboard].

* OpenShift Container Storage is now a supported storage solution for the observability service. For more information, see link:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#enable-observability[Enable observability service].

To learn more about observability, see link:../observability/observe_intro.adoc#observing-environments[Observing environments].

[#cluster-management]
== Cluster management

* You can import and manage clusters in the Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated environment. You can also manage IBM Z managed clusters. See link:../manage_cluster/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster] for more information.

* You can display information that is specific to a cluster by using `clusterclaims`. For more information, see link:../manage_cluster/clusterclaims.adoc#clusterclaims[ClusterClaims].

* **Technology preview:** Submariner is integrated to provide direct networking across clusters that are managed by {product-title-short}. See link:../manage_cluster/submariner.adoc#submariner[Submariner] documentation for more information.

* You can now limit permissions to create, manage, and import managed clusters to specific groups by creating and assigning a `clusterrole`. See link:../manage_cluster/clusterrole.adoc#configuring-a-specific-cluster-management-role[Configuring a specific cluster management role] for more information.

* You can now automatically list cluster image sets to keep your list of cluster image sets current. For more information, see link:../manage_cluster/rel_img_conn.adoc#maintaining-a-custom-list-of-release-images-when-connected[Maintaining a custom list of release images when connected].

* Automate an AnsibleTower task to run on a cluster, or on multiple clusters by creating an AnsibleJob. See link:../manage_cluster/ansible_job.adoc#creating-an-ansible-job-for-a-managed-cluster[Creating an AnsibleJob for a managed cluster] for more information. 

[#application-management]
== Application management

You can connect to a private repository using user and access token, which is an improvement in Git connection ability. See link:../manage_applications/configuring_git_channel.adoc#configuring-git-channel[Configuring application channel and subscription for a secure Git connection] for more information.

For all the application management changes and documentation, see link:../manage_applications/app_management_overview.adoc#managing-applications[Managing applications].

[#security-and-compliance]
== Security and compliance

* You can now install gatekeeper with the {product-title-short} gatekeeper operator policy. See link:../security/create_gatekeeper.adoc#install-gatekeeper-operator-policy[Installing gatekeeper using a gatekeeper operator policy] for more information.

* You can now install the {ocp} compliance operator with the compliance operator policy. See link:../security/compliance_operator_policy.adoc#compliance-operator-policy[Compliance operator policy] for more details.

* You can now create and apply an Essential 8 (E8) scan policy to scan master and worker nodes for compliance with the E8 profiles. For more details, see link:../security/e8_scan_policy.adoc#e8-scan-policy[E8 scan policy].

* You can now rotate internal managed certificates. For more information, see link:../security/certificates.adoc#certificates[Certificates].

See link:../security/grc_intro.adoc#governance-and-risk[Governance and risk] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
