[#cluster-whats-new]
== Clusters

* You can now select your {ocp-short} version 4.6 or later channel for your cluster upgrades in the {product-title-short} console. The channel selection informs you of available upgrades for your cluster. See link:../clusters/upgrade_cluster.adoc#selecting-a-channel[Selecting a channel] for more information.

* You can now edit the HiveConfig resource directly, and the `MultiClusterHub` operator does not revert the changes. If the HiveConfig resource is deleted, the `MultiClusterHub` operator recreates it exactly as it was configured when the `MultiClusterHub` resource was first created.

* Create a cluster from the console. See link:../clusters/create.adoc#creating-a-cluster[Creating a cluster] for more information. 

* Your credentials now update automatically on the managed cluster when you update them on the hub cluster. 

* Create a managed cluster from the new {product-title-short} console on the Red Hat OpenStack Platform. See link:../create_openstack.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-openstack[Creating a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform] for more information.  

* You can now import {ocp-short} clusters for management that are hosted on IBM Power systems. You can also test out Hosting the hub cluster on IBM Power systems is a Technology Preview function.

* Added information about managing bare metal assets using `BareMetalAsset` CRs and the {product-title-short} web console. See link:../clusters/bare_assets.adoc#creating-and-modifying-bare-metal-assets[Creating and modifying bare metal assets] for more information.

[#cluster-management-tech-preview]
=== Clusters (Technology Preview)

The following capabilities are _Technology Preview_ this release:

* You can test the ability to host the hub cluster on IBM Power systems.

* You can now group resources in a `ManagedClusterSet` to control the RBAC access permissions for managed clusters, cluster pools, cluster deployments, and cluster claims. See link:../clusters/managedclustersets.adoc/#managedclustersets[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets (Technology Preview)] for more information. 

* Configure `AnsibleJob` Templates to initiate with the installation or upgrade of a managed cluster. See link:../clusters/ansible_config_cluster.adoc##ansible-config-cluster[Configuring Ansible Tower tasks to run on managed clusters] for more information.

* Create cluster pools to better manage your resources and have configured {ocp} clusters available to claim when you need them. See link:../clusters/cluster_pool_manage.adoc#managing-cluster-pools[Managing cluster pools] for more information. 

* You can hibernate certain {ocp-short} managed clusters that are created by {product-title-short} to manage your resources with more flexibility. See link:../clusters/hibernating_a_cluster.adoc#hibernating-a-created-cluster[Hibernating a created cluster] for more information.

* You can now configure the Submariner networking service on VMware vSphere and Google Cloud Platform managed clusters. See link:../services/submariner.adoc#submariner[Submariner networking service] for more information. 

* You can now deploy Submariner on your clusters by using the {product-title-short} console. See link:../services/deploy_submariner.adoc#deploying-submariner-console[Deploying Submariner with the console] for more information.

* You can schedule AnsibleJob templates to run before or after cluster creation or installation by using the console. See link:../clusters/ansible_config_cluster.adoc#ansible-config-cluster[Setting up Ansible Tower tasks with cluster installation and upgrades (Technology Preview)] for more information.

* You can use the `MachinePools` resource to scale your clusters by using the {product-title-short} or the command line. See link:../clusters/scale.adoc#resizing-a-cluster[Resizing a cluster] for more information.
 
* Discover {ocp-short} 4 clusters that are now available from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_cluster_manager/2021-02/[OpenShift Cluster Manager]. After discovering clusters, you can import your clusters to manage. See the link:../clusters/discovery_intro.adoc[Discovery service introduction (Technology Preview)] for information.

[#application-management]
== Applications

 * You are now directed to the _Applications_ page after you select an application to view from the _Search_ page. See link:../console/search.adoc#search-argo[Query ArgoCD applications] for more information.

* Now if you deploy Argo applications on an {ocp-short} cluster with {product-title-short} installed, you can visualize Argo applications in the _Applications_ table and in the _Topology_ view.

* From the _Overview_ or the _Topology_ overview, you can launch an Argo editor and manage your Argo application. 

* Other improvements to the Application console include a _Commit hash_ and _Tag_, which are specific to the Git repository channel type. Additionally, new reconcile inputs are added for both Git and Helm repository types. 

* You can now select reconcile frequency options: high, medium, low, and off in channel configuration to avoid unnecessary resource reconciliations and prevent overload on subscription operator. See _Reconcile option_ in link:../applications/subscribe_git_resources.adoc#reconcile-frequency[Subscribing Git resources] for more information.

* The _Repository reconcile rate_ is added to the console with the default value set as `medium`. If auto-reconcile is disabled, the reconcile option is hidden because the resources will not either merge or replace what is currently reconciled.

* You can set up subscriptions to subscribe resources that are defined in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) object storage service. See link:../applications/manage_apps_object.adoc[Managing apps with Object storage repositories] for more information.
