[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console

The changes to the side-bar navigation align with other products and offer a better user experience. From the navigation, you can access various product features. 

* With the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/release_notes/ocp-4-10-release-notes.html#ocp-4-10-dynamic-plugin-technology-preview[{ocp} 4.10 release] and a more hybrid console, you can use dynamic plug-ins. See the {ocp-short} documentation about https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/web_console/dynamic-plug-ins.html#dynamic-plug-ins_dynamic-plug-ins[Adding a dynamic plug-in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console] to create and deploy a dynamic plug-in on your cluster that is loaded at run-time. 

* *Note:* Without plug-ins enabled on {ocp-short} versions 4.8 through 4.10, {product-title-short} is available in the _Perspective switcher_. To learn about the {product-title-short} console, see link:../console/console.adoc#console-overview[Console overview].

* The {product-title-short} plug-in is generally available for enablement from the {ocp-short} console. Learn how to enable in the link:../console/console.adoc#console-overview[Console overview].

Additionally, _Search_ is available in the navigation from the _Home_ tab and no longer from the header.

[#observability-whats-new]
=== Observability

* {product-title-short} supports {ocp-short} version 3.11 Grafana dashboards. See, the link:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#creating-mco-cr[Creating the MultiClusterObservability CR] section in _Enabling observability_ for more details.

* Customize certificates for accessing the object store that you use for the observability service. For more details, see link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#customizing-certificates-object-store[Customizing certificates for accessing the object store].

* Configure the observability service with Security Service Token credentials. For more information about what to configure, see link:../api/observability.json.adoc#observability-api[Observability API].

* Using the obbservability service, you can export metrics to external endpoints. For more details, see link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#export-metrics-to-external-endpoints[Export metrics to external endpoints].

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Clusters

* Some features of integrating Submariner multicluster networking service through {product-title-short} are generally available. See link:../add-ons/submariner/submariner.adoc#submariner[Submariner multicluster networking and service discovery] for more information. 

* Enable the Globalnet controller to resolve overlapping CIDRs when you enable the Submariner add-on. See link:../add-ons/submariner/submariner.adoc#submariner-globalnet[Globalnet] for more information. 

* Central Infrastucture Management now supports Metal3 on the following platforms: bare metal, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, VMware vSphere environments, or when it was installed using the user-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) method and the platform is `None`. 

* You can discover and add hosts to your infrastructure environment during the cluster creation process. See link:../clusters/create_cluster_on_prem.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-premises[Creating a cluster in an on-premises environment] for more information. 

* Use `ManagedClusterSet`, which is now generally available, to manage access to all of the managed clusters in the group together. See link:../clusters/managedclustersets.adoc[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets] for more information.

* Creates a `default` managed cluster set for any managed clusters that are not specifically assigned to a managed cluster set. See link:../clusters/managedclustersets.adoc#managedclustersets[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets] for more information.

* Specify a number of clusters in a cluster pool are immediately available to claim. See link:../clusters/cluster_pool_scale.adoc#scaling-cluster-pools[Scaling cluster pools] for more information. 

* Use {product-title-short} to create a {ocp-short} cluster on Red Hat Virtualization. See link:../clusters/create_virtualization.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-virtualization[Creating a cluster on Red Hat Virtualization] for more information. 

* Control the placements of your managed clusters and managed cluster sets using taints and tolerations. See link:../clusters/man_clust_taints_tol.adoc#taints-tolerations-manclust[Using taints and tolerations to place managed clusters] for more information.

* Learn to recover the backup and restore component by using the `backup-restore-enabled` policy. See link:../clusters/backup_and_restore.adoc#backup-validation-using-a-policy[Backup validation using a policy] for more information.

* Use {product-title-short} discovery to find OpenShift 4 clusters that are available from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_cluster_manager/2022/[OpenShift Cluster Manager]. Discovery is generally available, and the API is updated from `v1alpha1` to `v1`. 

  - After discovery, you can import your clusters to manage. The Discovery service uses the Discover Operator for back-end and console usage. See link:../clusters/discovery_intro.adoc[Discovery service introduction].
 
* You can now specify properties for a disconnected cluster in the credential when you use the {product-title-short} console to create a cluster for VMware vSphere or Red Hat OpenStack. See link:../credentials/credential_vm.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-vmware-vsphere[Creating a credential for VMware vSphere] and link:../credentials/credential_openstack.adoc#creating-a-credential-for-openstack[Creating a credential for Red Hat OpenStack] for more information.

The multicluster engine operator supports Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a prerequisite for the multicluster engine operator.

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

Placement and Placement decisions API is upgraded from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1`. Placements define the target clusters that must subscribe to a ClusterSet where subscriptions and application sets are delivered. View these in the console from *Advanced configuration*.

Access Topology from an individual tab in the single application overview so that you can view everything at the same time. Learn about the Topology from *How to read topology* to learn about each topology element.

`ApplicationSet` is now generally available as a sub-project of Argo CD that adds multicluster support for Argo CD applications. You can create an ApplicationSet from the product console editor.

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc[Managing applications].
