[#web-console-whats-new]
== Web console

The changes to the side-bar navigation align with other products and offer a better user experience. From the navigation, you can access various product features. 

* With the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/release_notes/ocp-4-10-release-notes.html#ocp-4-10-dynamic-plugin-technology-preview[{ocp} 4.10 release] and a more hybrid console, you can use dynamic plug-ins. See the {ocp-short} documentation about https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/web_console/dynamic-plug-ins.html#dynamic-plug-ins_dynamic-plug-ins[Adding a dynamic plug-in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console] to create and deploy a dynamic plug-in on your cluster that is loaded at run-time. 

* The {product-title-short} plug-in is generally available for enablement from the {ocp-short} console. Learn how to enable in the link:../console/console.adoc#console-overview[Console overview].

Additionally, _Search_ is available in the navigation from the _Home_ tab and no longer from the header.

[#observability-whats-new]
=== Observability

* {product-title-short} supports {ocp-short} version 3.11 Grafana dashboards. See, the link:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#creating-mco-cr[Creating the MultiClusterObservability CR] section in _Enabling observability_ for more details.

https://github.com/stolostron/rhacm-docs/blob/2.5_stage/observability/observability_enable.adoc#creating-mco-cr

* Customize certificates for accessing the object store that you use for the observability service. For more details, see link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#customizing-certificates-object-store[Customizing certificates for accessing the object store].

[#cluster-whats-new]
== Clusters

* Creates a `default` managed cluster set for any managed clusters that are not specifically assigned to a managed cluster set. See link:../clusters/managedclustersets.adoc#managedclustersets[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets] for more information.

* Specify a number of clusters in a cluster pool are immediately available to claim. See link:../clusters/cluster_pool_scale.adoc#scaling-cluster-pools[Scaling cluster pools] for more information. 

* Use {product-title-short} to create a {ocp-short} cluster on Red Hat Virtualization. See link../clusters/create_virtualization.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-virtualization[Creating a cluster on Red Hat Virtualization] for more information. 

* Control the placements of your managed clusters and managed cluster sets using taints and tolerations. See link:../clusters/man_clust_taints_tol.adoc#taints-tolerations-manclust[Using taints and tolerations to place managed clusters] for more information.

* Learn to recover the backup and restore component by using the `backup-restore-enabled` policy. See link:../clusters/backup_and_restore.adoc#backup-validation-using-a-policy[Backup validation using a policy] for more information.

* Use {product-title-short} discovery to find OpenShift 4 clusters that are available from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_cluster_manager/2022/[OpenShift Cluster Manager]. Discovery is generally available, and the API is updated from `v1alpha1` to `v1`. 

  - After discovery, you can import your clusters to manage. The Discovery service uses the Discover Operator for back-end and console usage. See link:../clusters/discovery_intro.adoc[Discovery service introduction].

* The _multicluster engine operator_ is generally available as a software operator that enhances cluster fleet management. The multicluster engine operator supports Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a prerequisite for the multicluster engine operator. 

 - **multicluster engine operator Technical Preview:** The `Managed-ServiceAccount` component allows you to create and delete a Service Account on a managed cluster. The component is disabled by default. See link:../multicluster_engine/addon_managed_service.adoc#managed-serviceaccount-addon[Enabling ManagedServiceAccount add-ons] to learn more.

[#application-whats-new]
== Applications

Placement and Placement decisions API is upgraded from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1`. Placements define the target clusters that must subscribe to a ClusterSet where subscriptions and application sets are delivered. View these in the console from *Advanced configuration*.

Access Topology from an individual tab in the single application overview so that you can view everything at the same time. Learn about the Topology from *How to read topology* to learn about each topology element.

`ApplicationSet` is now generally available as a sub-project of Argo CD that adds multicluster support for Argo CD applications. You can create an ApplicationSet from the product console editor.

For other Application topics, see link:../applications/app_management_overview.adoc[Managing applications].

[#governance-whats-new]
== Governance

* Use the optional YAML field, `metadataComplianceType`, to process labels and annotations of an object differently than the other fields. For more information, see the link:../apis/policy.adoc#policy-api[Policy API].

* Create a policy set to group policies together. See link:../governance/policy_set_ctrl.adoc#policy-set-controller[Policy set controller].

* Policy set generation is now supported for the policy generator. See link:../governance/policy_generator.adoc#policy-generator[Policy generator].

* You can use the `protect` function to secure sensitive data that is on your hub cluster policy template. Also, the `fromSecret` function is now available in the hub cluster policy templates. See link:../governance/custom_template.adoc##protect-function[protect function] section for more information

See link:../governance/grc_intro.adoc#governance[Governance] to learn more about the dashboard and the policy framework.
