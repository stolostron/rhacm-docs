Review the known issues for the {global-hub} Operator. The following list contains known issues for this release, or known issues that continued from the previous release. For your {ocp-short} cluster, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.15/html/release_notes/#ocp-4-15-known-issues) [{ocp-short} known issues].


[#detached-managed-hub-cluster]
== The detached managed hub cluster deletes and recreates the namespace and resources 
//2.12:15014

If you import a managed hub cluster in the hosted mode and detach this managed hub cluster, then it deletes and recreates the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace. The detached managed hub cluster also deletes and recreates all the related `addon` resources within this namespace. 

There is currently no workaround for this issue. 

[#kafka-operator-keeps-restarting]
== Kafka operator keeps restarting 

In the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) environment, the Kafka operator keeps restarting because of the out-of-memory (OOM) state. To fix this issue, set the resource limit to at least `512M`. For detailed steps on how to set this limit, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq_streams/2.6/html/deploying_and_managing_amq_streams_on_openshift/deploy-intro_str#assembly-fips-support-str[amq stream doc].

[#backup-and-restore-known-issues]
== Backup and restore known issues 

If your original {global-hub} cluster crashes, the {global-hub} loses its generated events and `cron` jobs. Even if you restore the new {global-hub} cluster, the events and `cron` jobs are not restored. To workaround this issue, you can manually run the `cron` job, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/multicluster_global_hub/multicluster-global-hub#global-hub-compliance-manual[Running the summarization process manually].

[#managed-cluster-not-counted]
== Managed cluster displays but is not counted

A managed cluster that is not created successfully, meaning `clusterclaim id.k8s.io` does not exist in the managed cluster, is not counted in the policy compliance dashboards, but shows in the policy console. 

[#operator-hyperlink]
== The {global-hub} is installed on {ocp-short} 4.13 hyperlinks might redirect home

If the {global-hub} Operator is installed on {ocp-short} 4.13, all hyperlinks that link to the managed clusters list and detail pages in dashboards might redirect to the {acm-short} home page. 

You need to manually go to your target page.

[#no-new-page-group-filter]
== The standard group filter cannot pass to the new page

In the _Global Hub Policy Group Compliancy Overview_ hub dashboards, you can check one data point by clicking *View Offending Policies for standard group*, but after you click this link to go to the offending page, the standard group filter cannot pass to the new page. 

This is also an issue for the *Cluster Group Compliancy Overview*.
