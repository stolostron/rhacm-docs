[#managed-cluster-not-counted]
== Managed cluster displays but is not counted

A managed cluster that is not created successfully, meaning `clusterclaim id.k8s.io` does not exist in the managed cluster, is not counted in the policy compliance dashboards, but shows in the policy console. 

[#operator-hyperlink]
== The {global-hub} is installed on {ocp-short} 4.13 hyperlinks might redirect home

If the {global-hub} Operator is installed on {ocp-short} 4.13, all hyperlinks that link to the managed clusters list and detail pages in dashboards might redirect to the {product-title-short} home page. 

You need to manually go to your target page.

[#no-new-page-group-filter]
== The standard group filter cannot pass to the new page

In the *Global Hub Policy Group Compliancy Overview* hub dashboards, you can check one data point by clicking **View Offending Policies for standard group**, but after you click this link to go to the offending page, the standard group filter cannot pass to the new page. 

This is also an issue for the **Cluster Group Compliancy Overview**.

[#cannot-redirect-ocp-cluster-obs]
== Cannot redirect to {ocp-short} 3.11 cluster _Observability_ page

If a managed hub cluster imports an {ocp-short} 3.11 cluster (deprecated) as managed cluster, it cannot redirect to the _Observability_ page in the *Global Hub* > *Overview* dashboard.

You need to manually navigate to your target page.
