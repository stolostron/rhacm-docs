Review the known issues for the {global-hub} Operator. The following list contains known issues for this release, or known issues that continued from the previous release. For your {ocp-short} cluster, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes#ocp-4-12-known-issues[{ocp-short} known issues].

[#managed-cluster-not-counted]
== Managed cluster displays but is not counted

A managed cluster that is not created successfully, meaning `clusterclaim id.k8s.io` does not exist in the managed cluster, is not counted in the policy compliance dashboards, but shows in the policy console. 

[#operator-hyperlink]
== The {global-hub} is installed on {ocp-short} 4.13 hyperlinks might redirect home

If the {global-hub} Operator is installed on {ocp-short} 4.13, all hyperlinks that link to the managed clusters list and detail pages in dashboards might redirect to the {product-title-short} home page. 

You need to manually go to your target page.

[#no-new-page-group-filter]
== The standard group filter cannot pass to the new page

In the *Global Hub Policy Group Compliancy Overview* hub dashboards, you can check one data point by clicking **View Offending Policies for standard group**, but after you click this link to go to the offending page, the standard group filter cannot pass to the new page. 

This is also an issue for the **Cluster Group Compliancy Overview**.

[#cannot-redirect-ocp-cluster-obs]
== Cannot redirect to {ocp-short} 3.11 cluster _Observability_ page

If a managed hub cluster imports an {ocp-short} 3.11 cluster (deprecated) as managed cluster, it cannot redirect to the _Observability_ page in the *Global Hub* > *Overview* dashboard.

You need to manually navigate to your target page.

[#compliance-job-failed-with-reimported-hub]
== Compliance cronjob might fail when reimport the managed hub with a different name

The compliance cronjob is used to summarize the daily status of the policy by compliance and event table. When the managed hub reimport to the global hub with a different name, that might caused two events of the same policy with different managed hub names on one day. This will cause the daily job run with the error like this `pq: ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE command cannot affect row a second time`.

Most simply, you can choose to restart the manager to end the error, and then running the following SQL to restore the compliance history data of yesterday

```sql
INSERT INTO history.local_compliance (policy_id, cluster_id, leaf_hub_name, compliance_date, compliance, compliance_changed_frequency)
WITH compliance_aggregate AS (
    SELECT
        cluster_id,
        policy_id,
        leaf_hub_name,
        CASE
            WHEN bool_or(compliance = 'non_compliant') THEN 'non_compliant'
            WHEN bool_or(compliance = 'unknown') THEN 'unknown'
            ELSE 'compliant'
        END::local_status.compliance_type AS aggregated_compliance
    FROM 
        event.local_policies lp
    WHERE 
        created_at BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 days' AND CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '0 day'
        AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM status.leaf_hubs lh
            WHERE lh.leaf_hub_name = lp.leaf_hub_name AND deleted_at IS NULL
        )
    GROUP BY
        cluster_id, policy_id, leaf_hub_name
)
SELECT
    policy_id,
    cluster_id,
    leaf_hub_name,

    aggregated_compliance,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(1) FROM (
            SELECT
                created_at,
                compliance,
                LAG(compliance) OVER (PARTITION BY cluster_id, policy_id ORDER BY created_at ASC) AS prev_compliance
            FROM
                event.local_policies lp
            WHERE
                (lp.created_at BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day' AND CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '0 day') 
                AND lp.cluster_id = ca.cluster_id AND lp.policy_id = ca.policy_id
            ORDER BY
                created_at ASC
        ) AS subquery
        WHERE compliance <> prev_compliance
    ) AS compliance_changed_frequency
FROM
    compliance_aggregate ca
ORDER BY
    cluster_id, policy_id;
ON CONFLICT (leaf_hub_name, policy_id, cluster_id, compliance_date)
DO UPDATE SET
    compliance = EXCLUDED.compliance,
    compliance_changed_frequency = EXCLUDED.compliance_changed_frequency;
