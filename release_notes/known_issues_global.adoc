[#managed-cluster-not-counted]
== Managed cluster displays but is not counted

[#operator-hyperlink]
== Global Hub Operator installed on {ocp-short} 4.13 hyperlinks might redirect home

If the Multicluster Global Hub Operator is installed on {ocp-short} 4.13, all hyperlinks that link to the managed clusters list and detail pages in dashboards might redirect to the {product-title-short} home page.
