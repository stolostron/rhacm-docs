= Deprecations and removals

Learn when parts of the product are deprecated or removed from {acm}. Consider the alternative actions in the _Recommended action_ and details, which display in the tables for the current release and for two prior releases.

*Deprecated:* {acm-short} 2.7 and earlier versions are no longer supported. The documentation might remain available, but without any Errata or other updates.

*Best practice:* Upgrade to the most recent version.

[#api-deprecations-info]
== API deprecations and removals

{acm-short} follows the Kubernetes deprecation guidelines for APIs. See the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/[Kubernetes Deprecation Policy] for more details about that policy. {acm-short} APIs are only deprecated or removed outside of the following timelines:
  
  - All `V1` APIs are generally available and supported for 12 months or three releases, whichever is greater. V1 APIs are not removed, but can be deprecated outside of that time limit.
  - All `beta` APIs are generally available for nine months or three releases, whichever is greater. Beta APIs are not removed outside of that time limit.
  - All `alpha` APIs are not required to be supported, but might be listed as deprecated or removed if it benefits users.
