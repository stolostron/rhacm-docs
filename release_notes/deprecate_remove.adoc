= Deprecations and removals

Learn when parts of the product are deprecated or removed from {product-title}.

*Note:* A _stabilized_ item is not deprecated or removed from a release of a product, but is no longer updated or developed. For instance, if an API is replaced with a new version in a release, but no longer updated, it can be listed in this topic as _stabilized_. The API is still available for one to three more releases before deprecated or removed.

Consider the alternative actions in the _Recommended action_ and details that are provided in a table only if stabilized functions are listed for the current release.

[#deprecations]
== Deprecations

A _deprecated_ component, feature, or service is supported, but no longer recommended for use and might become obsolete. Consider the alternative actions in the _Recommended action_ and details that are provided in the following table:

|===
|Product or category | Affected item | Version | Recommended action | More details and links

| Application management
| `HelmRepo` channel specification: usage of `insecureSkipVerify: "true"` is no longer inside the `configMapRef`
| 2.2
| Use `insecureSkipVerify: "true"` in the channel without the `configMapRef`
| See the YAML sample for the change.

[#api-deprecations]
=== Guidance for API deprecations

{product-title-short} follows the Kubernetes deprecation guidelines for APIs. See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/[Kubernetes Deprecation Policy] for more details about that policy. 

{product-title-short} APIs are only deprecated or removed outside of the following timelines:
  
  - All `V1` APIs are generally available and supported for 12 months or three releases, whichever is greater. V1 APIs are not removed, but can be deprecated outside of that time limit.
  - All `beta` APIs are generally available for nine months or three releases, whichever is greater. Beta APIs are not removed outside of that time limit.
  - All `alpha` APIs are not required to be supported, but might be listed as deprecated or removed if it benefits users.
