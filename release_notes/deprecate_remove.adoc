= Deprecations and removals

Learn when parts of the product are deprecated or removed from {acm}. Consider the alternative actions in the _Recommended action_ and details, which display in the tables for the current release and for two prior releases.

*Important:* The 2.6 and earlier versions of {product-title-short} are _removed_ and no longer supported. Documentation for versions 2.6 and earlier are not updated. The documentation might remain available, but is deprecated without any Errata or other updates available.

*Best practice:* Upgrade to the most recent version of {product-title-short}.
