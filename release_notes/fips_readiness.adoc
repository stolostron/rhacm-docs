[#fips-readiness]
= FIPS readiness

{acm} is designed for FIPS. When running on {ocp} in FIPS mode, {ocp-short} uses the Red Hat Enterprise Linux cryptographic libraries submitted to NIST for FIPS Validation on only the architectures that are supported by {ocp-short}. For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of the RHEL cryptographic libraries submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards]. 

If you plan to manage clusters with FIPS enabled, you must install {acm-short} on an {ocp-short} cluster configured to operate in FIPS mode. The hub cluster must be in FIPS mode because cryptography that is created on the hub cluster is used on managed clusters. 

To enable FIPS mode on your managed clusters, set `fips: true` when you provision your {ocp-short} managed cluster. You cannot enable FIPS after you provision your cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/installation_overview/installing-preparing#installing-preparing-security[Do you need extra security for your cluster?] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

[#fips-limitations]
== Limitations 

Read the following limitations with {acm-short} and FIPS.

* Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and S3 storage that is used by the search and observability components must be encrypted when you configure the provided storage. {acm-short} does not provide storage encryption, see the {ocp-short} documentation, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/storage/index#configuring-persistent-storage[Configuring persistent storage].

* When you provision managed clusters using the {acm-short} console, select the following checkbox in the _Cluster details_ section of the managed cluster creation to enable the FIPS standards:

FIPS with information text: Use the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) modules provided with Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS instead of the default Kubernetes cryptography suite file before you deploy the new managed cluster.
