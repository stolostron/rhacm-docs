[#fips-readiness]
= FIPS readiness

FIPS readiness has been completed for {product-title}. {product-title-short} uses the same tools to make sure cryptography calls are passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) certified cryptographic modules that are used by {ocp}. For more details on OpenShift FIPS support see, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/installing/installing-fips[Support for FIPS cryptography].

[#fips-limitations]
== Limitations 

Read the following limitations with {product-title-short} and FIPS.

* {ocp} does not support FIPS on the IBM Power (`ppc64le`) and IBM Z (`s390x`) architectures. 

* The following Technology preview components are not FIPS ready:
+
** Hub cluster backup and restore
** {assist-install}
** Submariner

* Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and S3 storage that is used by the search and observability components must be encrypted when you configure the provided storage. {product-title-short} does not provide storage encryption, see the {ocp-short} documentation, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/installing/installing-fips[Support for FIPS cryptography].

* When you provision managed clusters from {product-title-short}, you must set `fips: true` in the `install-config.yaml` file before you deploy the new managed cluster.
