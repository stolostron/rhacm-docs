[#fips-readiness]
= FIPS readiness

FIPS readiness has been completed for {product-title}. {product-title-short} uses the same tools to make sure cryptography calls are passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) certified cryptographic modules that are used by {ocp}}. For more details on OpenShift FIPS support see, link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing-fips.html[Support for FIPS cryptography].

//are users able to enable and disable FIPS? 

[#fips-limitations]
== Limitations 

Read the following limitations with {product-title-short} and FIPS.
//need to confirm the name of the Assissted Installer; it seems like it was renamed to Infrastructure Operator for Red Hat OpenShift
* The following Technology preview components are not FIPS ready:
+
* Hub cluster backup and restore
* {assist-install}
* Submariner
* VolSync
//what is storage layer? how about, "..components must be encrypted when you configure the storage?
* Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and S3 storage that is used by the search and observability components must be encrypted at the storage layer. {product-title-short} does not provide storage encryption, see the {ocp-short} documentation, link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing-fips.html[Support for FIPS cryptography]. 

* When you provision managed clusters from {product-title-short}, you must set `fips: true` in the `install-config.yaml` file before you deploy the new managed cluster.
