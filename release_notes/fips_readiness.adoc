[#fips-readiness]
= FIPS readiness

FIPS readiness has been completed for {product-title}. 

{ocp} is designed for FIPS. When running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS booted in FIPS mode, {ocp-short} core components use the Red Hat Enterprise Linux cryptographic libraries submitted to NIST for FIPS Validation on only the architectures supported by {ocp-short}. For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of the RHEL cryptographic libraries submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

If you plan to manage clusters with FIPS enabled, you must have a FIPS-ready hub cluster because cryptography that is created on the hub cluster is stored on the managed cluster. Enable FIPS with the `fips: true` setting when you provision your {ocp-short} managed cluster. You cannot enable FIPS after you provision your cluster.

[#fips-limitations]
== Limitations 

Read the following limitations with {product-title-short} and FIPS.

* Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and S3 storage that is used by the search and observability components must be encrypted when you configure the provided storage. {product-title-short} does not provide storage encryption, see the {ocp-short} documentation, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/storage/index#configuring-persistent-storage[Configuring persistent storage].

* When you provision managed clusters using the {product-title-short} console, select the following check box in the _Cluster details_ section of the managed cluster creation to enable the FIPS standards:

----
FIPS with information text: Use the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) modules provided with Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS instead of the default Kubernetes cryptography suite file before you deploy the new managed cluster.
