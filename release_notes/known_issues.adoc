[#links-to-higher-level]
=== Documentation links in the Customer Portal might link to a higher-level section
// 2.4:19417

In some cases, the internal links to other sections of the {product-title-short} documentation in the Customer Portal do not link directly to the named section. In some instances, the links resolve to the highest-level section. 

If this happens, you can either find the specified section manually or complete the following steps to resolve:

. Copy the link that is not resolving to the correct section and paste it in your browser address bar. For example, it might be: `https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html/clusters/index#volsync`.

. In the link, replace `html` with `html-single`. The new URL should read: `https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html-single/clusters/index#volsync`

. Link to the new URL to find the specified section in the documentation.

[#upgrade-2.2.x-issue]
=== Upgrade from 2.2.x to 2.3.4 might cause klusterlet deletion
// 2.4, 18011

After you upgrade from 2.2.x to 2.3.4, the Klusterlet might be deleted. See the following procedure to work around this issue:

. Upgrade the work-agent to 2.3.3.

.. Create a JSON file `work-image-override.json` with the following JSON content:
+
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "image-name": "work-rhel8",
    "image-remote": "registry.redhat.io/rhacm2",
    "image-digest": "sha256:b6606f6bb6504acfb48f13cd5296473c17088caf380097ff7ce316f781c4f196",
    "image-key": "work"
  }
] 
----

.. Create a ConfigMap for image override on the hub cluster:

+  
----
kubectl -n open-cluster-management create configmap work-image-override --from-file=./work-image-override.json
----

.. Enable the image override by annotating `mch` on the hub cluster.

+
----
kubectl -n open-cluster-management annotate mch multiclusterhub --overwrite mch-imageOverridesCM=work-image-override
----

.. Restart `multiclusterhub-operator` to enforce the change.

+
----
kubectl -n open-cluster-management delete pod multiclusterhub-operator-xxxxx-xxxxx
----

+
Wait for about 30 minutes to make sure that work-agent running on all managed clusters have been restarted with the overridden image.

. Upgrade from 2.2.x to 2.3.4.

. Disable the image override for work-agent. 

. After the upgrade is done, it's safe to remove the image override for work-agent.

+
----
kubectl -n open-cluster-management annotate mch multiclusterhub mch-imageOverridesCM- --overwrite
kubectl -n open-cluster-management delete configmap work-image-override
----

[#upgrade-231-error-chart]
=== Upgrade from version 2.2.x to 2.3.1 upgrade fails to progress
// 2.3.1: 15425

When you upgrade your {product-title-short} from version 2.2.x to 2.3.1, the upgrade fails. The `Multiclusterhub` status displays: `failed to download chart from helm repo` in the component error messages. You may also see errors that reference a problem with `no endpoints available for service "ocm-webhook"`.

On your hub cluster, run the following command in the namespace where {product-title-short} is installed to restart deployments and upgrade to version 2.3.1:

----
oc delete deploy ocm-proxyserver ocm-controller ocm-webhook multiclusterhub-repo
----

*Note:* The errors resolve, but the reconciliation process might not start immediately. This can be accelerated by restarting the `multicluster-operators-standalone-subscription` in the same namespace that the product is installed.

[#openshift-container-platform-cluster-upgrade-failed-status]
=== OpenShift Container Platform cluster upgrade failed status
// 2.0.0:3442

When an {ocp-short} cluster is in the upgrade stage, the cluster pods are restarted and the cluster might remain in `upgrade failed` status for a variation of 1-5 minutes. This behavior is expected and resolves after a few minutes.

[#search-result-node]
=== Node discrepancy between Cluster page and search results
// 2.0, 2.1, 2.2:9987

You might see a discrepancy between the nodes displayed on the _Cluster_ page and the _Search_ results.

[#ldap-user-names-are-case-sensitive]
=== LDAP user names are case-sensitive
// 1.0.0:before 1.0.0.1

LDAP user names are case-sensitive.
You must use the name exactly the way it is configured in your LDAP directory.

[#console-features-might-not-display-in-firefox-earlier-versions]
=== Console features might not display in Firefox earlier version
// 1.0.0:before 1.0.0.1

The product supports Mozilla Firefox 74.0 or the latest version that is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Upgrade to the latest version for the best console compatibility.

[#restrictions-for-storage-size-in-searchcustomization]
=== Restrictions for storage size in searchcustomization
//2.2:8501

When you update the storage size in the `searchcustomization` CR, the PVC configuration does not change. If you need to update the storage size, update the PVC (`_<storageclassname>-search-redisgraph-0_`) with the following command:
----
oc edit pvc <storageclassname>-search-redisgraph-0
----

[#duplicate-local-clusters-in-kubernetes-service-level-overview-api-server-dashboard]
=== Duplicate local-clusters on Service-level Overview dashboard
//2.4:16885

When various hub clusters deploy {product-title-short} observability using the same S3 storage, _duplicate_ `local-clusters` can be detected and displayed within the _Kubernetes/Service-Level Overview/API Server_ dashboard. The duplicate clusters affect the results within the following panels: _Top Clusters_, _Number of clusters that has exceeded the SLO_, and _Number of clusters that are meeting the SLO_. The `local-clusters` are unique clusters associated with the shared S3 storage. To prevent multiple `local-clusters` from displaying within the dashboard, it is recommended for each unique hub cluster to deploy observability with a S3 bucket specifically for the hub cluster.

[#observability-endpoint-operator-fails-to-pull-image]
=== Observability endpoint operator fails to pull image
//2.2:9259

The observability endpoint operator fails if you create a pull-secret to deploy to the MultiClusterObservability CustomResource (CR) and there is no pull-secret in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace. When you import a new cluster, or import a Hive cluster that is created with {product-title-short}, you need to manually create a pull-image secret on the managed cluster.

For more information, see link:../observability/observability_enable.adoc#enabling-observability[Enabling observability].

[#missing-data-roks]
=== There is no data from ROKS cluster
//2.2.3:12114

{product-title-short} observability does not display data from an ROKS cluster on some panels within built-in dashboards. This is because ROKS does not expose any API Server metrics from servers they manage. The following Grafana dashboards contain panels that do not support ROKS clusters: `Kubernetes/API server`, `Kubernetes/Compute Resources/Workload`, `Kubernetes/Compute Resources/Namespace(Workload)`

[#missing-etcd-data-roks]
=== There is no etcd data from ROKS clusters
//2.2.3:12114

For ROKS clusters, {product-title-short} observability does not display data in the _etcd_ panel of the dashboard.

[#search-high-cpu]
=== High CPU usage by the search-collector pod
//2.3.13897

When search is disabled on a hub cluster that manages 1000 clusters, the `search-collector` pod crashes due to the out-of-memory error (OOM). Complete the following steps:

. If search is disabled on the hub cluster, which means the `search-redisgraph-pod` is not deployed, reduce memory usage by scaling down the `search-collector` deployment to `0` replicas.

. If search is enabled on the hub cluster, which means the `search-redisgraph-pod` is deployed, increase the allocated memory by editing the `search-collector` deployment.

[#search-pods-fail-invalid-certs]
=== Search pods fail to complete the TLS handshake due to invalid certificates
//2.3:14859

In some rare cases, the search pods are not automatically redeployed after certificates change. This causes a mismatch of certificates across the service pods, which causes the Transfer Layer Security (TLS) handshake to fail. To fix this problem, restart the search pods to reset the certificates.

[#observability-annotation-query-failed]
=== Metrics are unavailable in the Grafana console

* Annotation query failed in the Grafana console: 
// 2.1.0:5625
+
When you search for a specific annotation in the Grafana console, you might receive the following error message due to an expired token: 
+
`"Annotation Query Failed"`
+
Refresh your browser and verify you are logged into your hub cluster.

* Error in _rbac-query-proxy_ pod:
+
Due to unauthorized access to the `managedcluster` resource, you might receive the following error when you query a cluster or project:
+
`no project or cluster found`
+
Check the role permissions and update appropriately. See link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] for more information. 

[#prometheus-data-loss]
=== Prometheus data loss on managed clusters
//2.4:17137

By default, Prometheus on OpenShift uses ephemeral storage. Prometheus loses all metrics data whenever it is restarted.

When observability is enabled or disabled on {ocp-short} managed clusters that are managed by {product-title-short}, the observability endpoint operator updates the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` by adding additional alertmanager configuration that restarts the local Prometheus automatically. 

[#error-ingesting-out-of-order-samples]
=== Error ingesting out-of-order samples
//2.4:15666

Observability `receive` pods report the following error message:

----
Error on ingesting out-of-order samples
----

The error message means that the time series data sent by a managed cluster, during a metrics collection interval is older than the time series data it sent in the previous collection interval. When this problem happens, data is discarded by the Thanos receivers and this might create a gap in the data shown in Grafana dashboards. If the error is seen frequently, it is recommended to increase the metrics collection interval to a higher value. For example, you can increase the interval to 60 seconds.

The problem is only noticed when the time series interval is set to a lower value, such as 30 seconds. Note, this problem is not seen when the metrics collection interval is set to the default value of 300 seconds.

[#clusterimageset-fast-channel]
=== Cluster and `clusterimageset` channels do not synchronize automatically
//2.4:17790

The `clusterimageset` is in `"fast"` channel, but the provisioned cluster is in `"stable"` channel. Currently, the product does not sync the `"channel"` to the provisioned {ocp-short} cluster. 

Change to the right channel in the {ocp-short} console: **Administration** > **Cluster Settings** > **Details Channel**.

[#ca-certificate-hub-restore]
=== Restoring the connection of a managed cluster with custom CA certificates to its restored hub cluster might fail
//2.4:19481

After you restore the backup of a hub cluster that managed a cluster with custom CA certificates, the connection between the managed cluster and the hub cluster might fail. This is because the CA certificate was not backed up on the restored hub cluster. To restore the connection, copy the custom CA certificate information that is in the namespace of your managed cluster to the `<managed_cluster>-admin-kubeconfig` secret on the restored hub cluster. 

**Tip:** If you copy this CA certificate to the hub cluster before creating the backup copy, the backup copy includes the secret information. When the backup copy is used to restore in the future, the connection between the hub and managed clusters will automatically complete. 

[#local-cluster-auto]
=== The local-cluster might not be automatically recreated
//2.4:17790

If the local-cluster is deleted while `disableHubSelfManagement` is set to `false`, the local-cluster is recreated by the `MulticlusterHub` operator. After you detach a local-cluster, the local-cluster might not be automatically recreated. 

- To resolve this issue, modify a resource that is watched by the `MulticlusterHub` operator. See the following example:

+
----
oc delete deployment multiclusterhub-repo -n <namespace>
----

- To properly detach the local-cluster, set the `disableHubSelfManagement` to true in the `MultiClusterHub`.  

[#subnet-required-on-prem-clust-create]
=== Selecting a subnet is required when creating an on-premises cluster
//2.4:18387

When you create an on-premises cluster using the {product-title-short} console, you must select an available subnet for your cluster. It is not marked as a required field. 


[#create-fail-gcp]
=== Cluster provisioning on Google Cloud Platform fails
//2.4:17930

When you try to provision a cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), it might fail with the following error:

----
Cluster initialization failed because one or more operators are not functioning properly.
The cluster should be accessible for troubleshooting as detailed in the documentation linked below,
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-installations.html
The 'wait-for install-complete' subcommand can then be used to continue the installation
----

You can work around this error by enabling the https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/networksecurity.googleapis.com[Network Security API] on the GCP project, which allows your cluster installation to continue.  

[#iso-image-name-too-long]
=== Cluster provisioning with Infrastructure Operator fails
//2.4:17411

When creating {ocp-short} clusters using the Infrastructure Operator, the file name of the ISO image might be too long. The long image name causes the image provisioning and the cluster provisioning to fail. To determine if this is the problem, complete the following steps: 

. View the bare metal host information for the cluster that you are provisioning by running the following command: 
+
----
oc get bmh -n <cluster_provisioning_namespace>
----

. Run the `describe` command to view the error information:
+
----
oc describe bmh -n <cluster_provisioning_namespace> <bmh_name>
----

. An error similar to the following example indicates that the length of the filename is the problem: 
+
----
Status:
  Error Count:    1
  Error Message:  Image provisioning failed: ... [Errno 36] File name too long ...
----

If this problem occurs, it is typically on the following versions of {ocp-short}, because the infrastructure operator was not using image service:

* 4.8.17 and earlier
* 4.9.6 and earlier

To avoid this error, upgrade your {ocp-short} to version 4.8.18 or later, or 4.9.7 or later.

[#cannot-hibernate-azure-gov]
=== Cannot hibernate an Azure Government cluster
//2.4:17580

When you try to hibernate an Azure Government cluster, the hibernation fails with the following error that is added to the provision pod log:

----
Confidential Client is not supported in Cross Cloud request
----

[#cluster-local-offline-reimport]
=== Local-cluster status offline after reimporting with a different name
//2.4:16977

When you accidentally try to reimport the cluster named `local-cluster` as a cluster with a different name, the status for `local-cluster` and for the reimported cluster display `offline`.

To recover from this case, complete the following steps:

. Run the following command on the hub cluster to edit the setting for self-management of the hub cluster temporarily:
+
----
oc edit mch -n open-cluster-management multiclusterhub
----

. Add the setting `spec.disableSelfManagement=true`.

. Run the following command on the hub cluster to delete and redeploy the local-cluster:
+
----
oc delete managedcluster local-cluster
----

. Enter the following command to remove the `local-cluster` management setting: 
+
----
oc edit mch -n open-cluster-management multiclusterhub
----

. Remove `spec.disableSelfManagement=true` that you previously added.

[#cluster-provision-fails-ansible-proxy]
=== Cluster provision with Ansible automation fails in proxy environment
//2.4:17659

An AnsibleJob template that is configured to automatically provision a managed cluster might fail when both of the following conditions are met: 

* The hub cluster has cluster-wide proxy enabled. 
* The Ansible Tower can only be reached through the proxy.

[#klusterlet-operator-version-same-as-cluster]
=== Version of the klusterlet operator must be the same as the hub cluster
//2.4:17219

If you import a managed cluster by installing the klusterlet operator, the version of the klusterlet operator must be the same as the version of the hub cluster or the klusterlet operator will not work.

[#no-delete-cluster-namespace-before-remove-cluster]
=== Cannot delete managed cluster namespace manually
//2.3:13474

You cannot delete the namespace of a managed cluster manually. The managed cluster namespace is automatically deleted after the managed cluster is detached. If you delete the managed cluster namespace manually before the managed cluster is detached, the managed cluster shows a continuous terminating  status after you delete the managed cluster. To delete this terminating managed cluster, manually remove the finalizers from the managed cluster that you detached.

[#no-change-upgrade-cred]
=== Cannot change credentials on clusters after upgrading to version 2.3
//2.3:14098

After you upgrade {product-title-short} to version 2.3, you cannot change the credential secret for any of the managed clusters that were created and managed by {product-title-short} before the upgrade.  

[#no-create-bm-47]
=== Cannot create bare metal managed clusters on {ocp-short} version 4.8
// 2.2:10581

You cannot create bare metal managed clusters by using the {product-title-short} hub cluster when the hub cluster is hosted on {ocp-short} version 4.8.

[#hub-managed-clusters-clock]
=== Hub cluster and managed clusters clock not synced
// 2.1:5636

Hub cluster and manage cluster time might become out-of-sync, displaying in the console `unknown` and eventually `available` within a few minutes. Ensure that the {ocp} hub cluster time is configured correctly. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/installing/install_config/installing-customizing.html[Customizing nodes].

[#importing-certain-versions-of-ibm-red-hat-openshift-kubernetes-service-clusters-is-not-supported]
=== Importing certain versions of IBM {ocp-short} Kubernetes Service clusters is not supported
// 1.0.0:2179

You cannot import IBM {ocp-short} Kubernetes Service version 3.11 clusters.
Later versions of IBM OpenShift Kubernetes Service are supported.

[#detaching-openshift-container-platform-3.11-does-not-remove-the-open-cluster-management-agent]
=== Detaching {ocp-short} 3.11 does not remove the _open-cluster-management-agent_
// 2.0.0:3847

When you detach managed clusters on {ocp-short} 3.11, the `open-cluster-management-agent` namespace is not automatically deleted. Manually remove the namespace by running the following command:

----
oc delete ns open-cluster-management-agent
----

[#automatic-secret-updates-for-provisioned-clusters-is-not-supported]
=== Automatic secret updates for provisioned clusters is not supported
// 2.0.0:3702

When you change your cloud provider access key, the provisioned cluster access key is not updated in the namespace. This is required when your credentials expire on the cloud provider where the managed cluster is hosted and you try delete the managed cluster. If something like this occurs, run the following command for your cloud provider to update the access key: 

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)

+
----
oc patch secret {CLUSTER-NAME}-aws-creds -n {CLUSTER-NAME} --type json -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/stringData", "value":{"aws_access_key_id": "{YOUR-NEW-ACCESS-KEY-ID}","aws_secret_access_key":"{YOUR-NEW-aws_secret_access_key}"} }]'
----

* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

+
You can identify this issue by a repeating log error message that reads, `Invalid JWT Signature` when you attempt to destroy the cluster. If your log contains this message, obtain a new Google Cloud Provider service account JSON key and enter the following command:

+
----
oc set data secret/<CLUSTER-NAME>-gcp-creds -n <CLUSTER-NAME> --from-file=osServiceAccount.json=$HOME/.gcp/osServiceAccount.json
----
+
Replace `_CLUSTER-NAME_` with the name of your cluster.
+
Replace the path to the file `$HOME/.gcp/osServiceAccount.json` with the path to the file that contains your new Google Cloud Provider service account JSON key. 


* Microsoft Azure 

+
----
oc set data secret/{CLUSTER-NAME}-azure-creds -n {CLUSTER-NAME} --from-file=osServiceAccount.json=$HOME/.azure/osServiceAccount.json
----

* VMware vSphere

+
----
oc patch secret {CLUSTER-NAME}-vsphere-creds -n {CLUSTER-NAME} --type json -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/stringData", "value":{"username": "{YOUR-NEW-VMware-username}","password":"{YOUR-NEW-VMware-password}"} }]'
----

[#node-information-from-the-managed-cluster-cannot-be-viewed-in-search]
=== Node information from the managed cluster cannot be viewed in search
// 2.0.2:4598

Search maps RBAC for resources in the hub cluster. Depending on user RBAC settings for {product-title-short}, users might not see node data from the managed cluster. Results from search might be different from what is displayed on the _Nodes_ page for a cluster.

[#cluster-might-not-be-destroyed]
=== Process to destroy a cluster does not complete
// 2.1.0:4748

When you destroy a managed cluster, the status continues to display `Destroying` after one hour, and the cluster is not destroyed. To resolve this issue complete the following steps:

. Manually ensure that there are no orphaned resources on your cloud, and that all of the provider resources that are associated with the managed cluster are cleaned up.

. Open the `ClusterDeployment` information for the managed cluster that is being removed by entering the following command:
+
----
oc edit clusterdeployment/<mycluster> -n <namespace>
----
+
Replace `_mycluster_` with the name of the managed cluster that you are destroying.
+
Replace `_namespace_` with the namespace of the managed cluster.

. Remove the `hive.openshift.io/deprovision` finalizer to forcefully stop the process that is trying to clean up the cluster resources in the cloud.

. Save your changes and verify that `ClusterDeployment` is gone.

. Manually remove the namespace of the managed cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc delete ns <namespace>
----
+
Replace `_namespace_` with the namespace of the managed cluster.

[#no-upgrade-os-on-osd]
=== Cannot upgrade {ocp-short} managed clusters on {ocp-short} Dedicated with the console
// 2.2.0:8922

You cannot use the {product-title-short} console to upgrade {ocp-short} managed clusters that are in the {ocp-short} Dedicated environment.

[#work-manager-addon-search]
=== Work manager add-on search details
//2.3.0: 13715

The search details page for a certain resource on a certain managed cluster might fail. You must ensure that the work-manager add-on in the managed cluster is in `Available` status before you can search.

[#no-create-clusters-across-architectures]
=== A manually-created release image is required when creating clusters across architectures
//2.2.3:14631

To create a managed cluster on a different architecture than the architecture of the hub cluster, you need to create a release image (`ClusterImageSet`) that contains files for both architectures. For example, you need to create a release image if you want to create an `x86_64` cluster from a `ppc64le` or `s390x` hub cluster. If you create the release image with both sets of files, the cluster creation succeeds because the new release image enables the {ocp-short} release registry to provide a multi-architecture image manifest. 

To work around this issue, complete steps similar to the following example for your architecture type:

. From the https://quay.io/repository/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release[{ocp-short} release registry], create a https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[manifest list] that includes `x86_64`, `s390x` and `ppc64le` release images.

.. Pull the manifest lists for both architectures in your environment from the Quay repository:
+
----
$ podman pull quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.9.1-x86_64
$ podman pull quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.9.1-ppc64le
$ podman pull quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.9.1-s390x
----

.. Log in to your private repository where you maintain your images:
+
----
$ podman login <private-repo>
----
+
Replace `private-repo` with the path to your repository.

.. Add the release image manifest to your private repository by running the following commands that apply to your environment:
+
----
$ podman push quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.9.1-x86_64 <private-repo>/ocp-release:4.9.1-x86_64
$ podman push quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.9.1-ppc64le <private-repo>/ocp-release:4.9.1-ppc64le
$ podman push quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.9.1-s390x <private-repo>/ocp-release:4.9.1-s390x
----
+
Replace `private-repo` with the path to your repository.

.. Create a manifest for the new information:
+
---- 
$ podman manifest create mymanifest
----

.. Add references to both release images to the manifest list:
+
----
$ podman manifest add mymanifest <private-repo>/ocp-release:4.9.1-x86_64
$ podman manifest add mymanifest <private-repo>/ocp-release:4.9.1-ppc64le
$ podman manifest add mymanifest <private-repo>/ocp-release:4.9.1-s390x
----
+
Replace `private-repo` with the path to your repository.

.. Merge the list in your manifest list with the existing manifest:
+
----
$ podman manifest push mymanifest docker://<private-repo>/ocp-release:4.9.1
----
+
Replace `private-repo` with the path to your repository.

. On the hub cluster, create a release image that references the manifest in your repository.

.. Create a `YAML` file that contains information that is similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hive.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterImageSet
metadata:
  labels:
    channel: fast
    visible: "true"
  name: img4.9.1-appsub
spec:
  releaseImage: <private-repo>/ocp-release:4.9.1
----
+
Replace `private-repo` with the path to your repository.

.. Run the following command on your hub cluster to apply the changes:
+
----
oc apply -f <file-name>.yaml
----
+
Replace `file-name` with the name of the `YAML` file that you just created. 

. Select the new release image when you create your {ocp-short} cluster. 

The creation process uses the merged release images to create the cluster.  

[#argo-not-supported-power]

You cannot use the Ansible Tower integration when the {product-title} hub cluster is running on IBM Power or IBM Z systems because the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ansible-automation-platform/platform-resource-rhel7-operator/5f6a0f22592d9a52663ccab6[Ansible Automation Platform Resource Operator] does not provide `ppc64le` or `s390x` images.

[#non-ocp-logs]
=== Non-{ocp} managed clusters must have LoadBalancer enabled
//2.4:15705

Both {ocp} and non-{ocp-short} clusters support the pod log feature, however non-{ocp-short} clusters require `LoadBalancer` to be enabled to use the feature. Complete the following steps to enable `LoadBalancer`:

. Cloud providers have different `LoadBalancer` configurations. Visit your cloud provider documentation for more information. 
. Verify if `LoadBalancer` is enabled on your {product-title-short} by checking the `loggingEndpoint` in the status of `managedClusterInfo`. 
. Run the following command to check if the `loggingEndpoint.IP` or `loggingEndpoint.Host` has a valid IP address or host name:
+
----
oc get managedclusterinfo <clusterName> -n <clusterNamespace> -o json | jq -r '.status.loggingEndpoint'
----

For more information about the `LoadBalancer` types, see the _Service_ page in the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service[Kubernetes documentation.]

== Application management known issues

[#policy-needs-subscription-admin]
=== Policy resource not deployed unless by subscription administrator
//2.4.0: 17819

The `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1` resources are no longer deployed by an application subscription by default for {product-title-short} version 2.4.

A subscription administrator needs to deploy the application subscription to change this default behavior.

See link:../applications/allow_deny.adoc[Creating an allow and deny list as subscription administrator] for information. `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1` resources that were deployed by existing application subscriptions in previous {product-title-short} versions remain, but are no longer reconciled with the source repository unless the application subscriptions are deployed by a subscription administrator.

[#app-topology-not-grouped-properly]
=== Application topology clusters with multiple subscriptions not grouped properly 
//2.3.0: 14107

A cluster might not group properly in the _Application topology_ if the cluster is using multiple subscriptions.

When you deploy an application with multiple subscriptions, you might see that the _All subscriptions_ view does not group the cluster nodes properly. 

For instance, when you deploy an application with multiple subscriptions containing a mixed combination of _Helm_ and _Git_ repositories, the _All subscriptions_ view does not display statuses correctly for the resources within the Helm subscription.

View the topology from the individual subscription views instead to display the correct cluster node grouping information.

[#application-ansible-standalone]
=== Application Ansible hook stand-alone mode
// 2.2:8036

Ansible hook stand-alone mode is not supported. To deploy Ansible hook on the hub cluster with a subscription, you might use the following subscription YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: sub-rhacm-gitops-demo
  namespace: hello-openshift
annotations:
  apps.open-cluster-management.io/github-path: myapp
  apps.open-cluster-management.io/github-branch: master
spec:
  hooksecretref:
      name: toweraccess
  channel: rhacm-gitops-demo/ch-rhacm-gitops-demo
  placement:
     local: true
----

However, this configuration might never create the Ansible instance, since the `spec.placement.local:true` has the subscription running on `standalone` mode. You need to create the subscription in hub mode. 

. Create a placement rule that deploys to `local-cluster`. See the following sample:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementRule
metadata: 
  name: <towhichcluster>
  namespace: hello-openshift
spec:
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      local-cluster: "true" #this points to your hub cluster
----

. Reference that placement rule in your subscription. See the following:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: sub-rhacm-gitops-demo
  namespace: hello-openshift
annotations:
  apps.open-cluster-management.io/github-path: myapp
  apps.open-cluster-management.io/github-branch: master
spec:
  hooksecretref:
      name: toweraccess
  channel: rhacm-gitops-demo/ch-rhacm-gitops-demo
  placement:
     placementRef:
        name: <towhichcluster>
        kind: PlacementRule
----

After applying both, you should see the Ansible instance created in your hub cluster.

[#edit-role-for-application-error]
=== Edit role for application error
// 2.0.0:1681

A user performing in an `Editor` role should only have `read` or `update` authority on an application, but erroneously editor can also `create` and `delete` an application. {ocp-short} Operator Lifecycle Manager default settings change the setting for the product. To workaround the issue, see the following procedure:

1. Run `oc edit clusterrole applications.app.k8s.io-v1beta2-edit -o yaml` to open the application edit cluster role.
2. Remove `create` and `delete` from the verbs list.
3. Save the change.

[#edit-role-for-placement-rule-error]
=== Edit role for placement rule error
// 2.0.0:3693

A user performing in an `Editor` role should only have `read` or `update` authority on an placement rule, but erroneously editor can also `create` and `delete`, as well. {ocp-short} Operator Lifecycle Manager default settings change the setting for the product. To workaround the issue, see the following procedure:

1. Run `oc edit clusterrole placementrules.apps.open-cluster-management.io-v1-edit` to open the application edit cluster role.
2. Remove `create` and `delete` from the verbs list.
3. Save the change.

[#application-not-deployed-after-an-updated-placement-rule]
=== Application not deployed after an updated placement rule
// 1.0.0:1449

If applications are not deploying after an update to a placement rule, verify that the `klusterlet-addon-appmgr` pod is running.
The `klusterlet-addon-appmgr` is the subscription container that needs to run on endpoint clusters.

You can run `oc get pods -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon` to verify.

You can also search for `kind:pod cluster:yourcluster` in the console and see if the `klusterlet-addon-appmgr` is running.

If you cannot verify, attempt to import the cluster again and verify again.

[#subscription-operator-does-not-create-an-scc]
=== Subscription operator does not create an SCC
// 1.0.0:1764

Learn about {ocp} SCC at https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html#security-context-constraints-about_configuring-internal-oauth[Managing Security Context Constraints (SCC)], which is an additional configuration required on the managed cluster.

Different deployments have different security context and different service accounts.
The subscription operator cannot create an SCC automatically.
Administrators control permissions for pods.
A Security Context Constraints (SCC) CR is required to enable appropriate permissions for the relative service accounts to create pods in the non-default namespace:

To manually create an SCC CR in your namespace, complete the following:

. Find the service account that is defined in the deployments.
For example, see the following `nginx` deployments:
+
----
 nginx-ingress-52edb
 nginx-ingress-52edb-backend
----

. Create an SCC CR in your namespace to assign the required permissions to the service account or accounts.
See the following example where `kind: SecurityContextConstraints` is added:
+
[source,yaml]
----
 apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
 defaultAddCapabilities:
 kind: SecurityContextConstraints
 metadata:
   name: ingress-nginx
   namespace: ns-sub-1
 priority: null
 readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
 requiredDropCapabilities:
 fsGroup:
   type: RunAsAny
 runAsUser:
   type: RunAsAny

 - system:serviceaccount:my-operator:nginx-ingress-52edb
 - system:serviceaccount:my-operator:nginx-ingress-52edb-backend
----

[#application-channels-require-unique-namespaces]
=== Application channels require unique namespaces
// 1.0.0:2311

Creating more than one channel in the same namespace can cause errors with the hub cluster.

For instance, namespace `charts-v1` is used by the installer as a Helm type channel, so do not create any additional channels in `charts-v1`. Ensure that you create your channel in a unique namespace. All channels need an individual namespace, except GitHub channels, which can share a namespace with another GitHub channel.

[#ansible-automation-platform-fail]
=== Ansible Automation Platform job fail

Ansible jobs fail to run when you select an incompatible option. Ansible Automation Platform only works when the `-cluster-scoped` channel options are chosen. This affects all components that need to perform Ansible jobs.

[#ansible-automation-operator-access]
=== Ansible Automation Platform operator access Ansible Tower outside of a proxy

The Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) operator cannot access Ansible Tower outside of a proxy-enabled {ocp-short} cluster. To resolve, you can install the Ansible tower within the proxy. See install steps that are provided by Ansible Tower.

[#helm-template-argo]
=== Template information does not show when editing a Helm Argo application in version 2.4
// 2.4 prior to 2.4.1:17642

When a Helm Argo application is created and then edited, the template information appears empty while the YAML file is correct. Upgrade to Errata 2.4.1 to fix the error.

[#application-name]
=== Application name requirements
// 2.3:#14310

An application name cannot exceed 37 characters. The application deployment displays the following error if the characters exceed this amount.

[source,yaml]
----
status:
  phase: PropagationFailed
  reason: 'Deployable.apps.open-cluster-management.io "_long_lengthy_name_" is invalid: metadata.labels: Invalid value: "_long_lengthy_name_": must be no more than 63 characters/n'
----

[#application-tables]
=== Application console tables
// 2.3:12410

See the following limitations to various _Application_ tables in the console:

- From the _Applications_ table on the _Overview_ page and the _Subscriptions_ table on the _Advanced configuration_ page, the _Clusters_ column displays a count of clusters where application resources are deployed. Since applications are defined by resources on the local cluster, the local cluster is included in the search results, whether actual application resources are deployed on the local cluster or not.

- From the _Advanced configuration_ table for _Subscriptions_, the _Applications_ column displays the total number of applications that use that subscription, but if the subscription deploys child applications, those are included in the search result, as well.

- From the _Advanced configuration_ table for _Channels_, the _Subscriptions_ column displays the total number of subscriptions on the local cluster that use that channel, but this does not include subscriptions that are deployed by other subscriptions, which are included in the search result.

[#unable-to-log-out]
=== Unable to log out from Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management

When you use an external identity provider to log in to {product-title-short}, you might not be able to log out of {product-title-short}. This occurs when you use {product-title-short}, installed with IBM Cloud and Keycloak as the identity providers.

You must log out of the external identity provider before you attempt to log out of {product-title-short}. 

[#placement-console-support]
=== Placement resource limitations

As a reminder, a policy must use either a `PlacementRule` or a `Placement` resource to control the deployment of policies to specific managed clusters. If you create policies that use the `Placement` resource, you might encounter the following limitations:

* The placement information is not shown when you view the details of the policy from the console.
* The placement information is not removed when the policy is deleted from the console.
* When you edit the policy from the console, the placement details are not updated. 

Use the command line interface (CLI) to make updates to the policies when you use the `Placement` resource.

[#gatekeeper-upgrade]
=== Gatekeeper operator installation fails
//2.4:16673

When you install the gatekeeper operator on {ocp} version 4.9, the installation fails. Before you upgrade {ocp-short} to version 4.9.0., you must upgrade the gatekeeper operator to version 0.2.0. See link:../governance/create_gatekeeper.adoc#upgrading-gatekeeper-gatekeeper-operator[Upgrading gatekeeper and the gatekeeper operator] for more information.

[#config-policy-stuck]
=== Configuration policy listed complaint when namespace is stuck in _Terminating_ state
//2.2:20715

When you have a configuration policy that is configured with `mustnothave` for the `complianceType` parameter and `enforce` for the `remediationAction` parameter, the policy is listed as compliant after a deletion request is made to the Kubernetes API. Therefore, the Kubernetes object can be stuck in a `Terminating` state while the policy is listed as compliant.

[#backup-known-issues]
== Backup and restore known issues

[#no-backup-power-z]
=== Backup and restore feature does not work on IBM Power and IBM Z
//2.4:17229

The backup and restore feature for the hub cluster requires the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) operator. The OADP operator is not available on the IBM Power or IBM Z architectures.

[#no-resource-status-after-restore]
=== Application and policy show no resource status on managed cluster after a restore operation
//2.4:17342

When a restore operation is run on a new hub cluster, using data backed up from another hub cluster, the application and policy shows no status for resources on managed clusters. This happens because the search and policy add-ons are not reset to point to the new hub cluster. 

From the new hub cluster, you must restart the `addon-certpolicyctrl` and `addon-search` for all managed clusters. Run the following commands to restart the pods:

----
oc get pods -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon | grep search | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete pod
----
