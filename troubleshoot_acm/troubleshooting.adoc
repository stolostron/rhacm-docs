= Troubleshooting

Before using the Troubleshooting guide, you can run the `oc adm must-gather` command to gather details, logs, and take steps in debugging issues. Additionally, check your role-based access in the introduction for link:../security/security_intro.adoc#role-based-access-control[Security].

[#must-gather]
== Must-gather

To get started, learn about the troubleshooting scenarios, which include cases for both using and not using the `must-gather` command to debug the issues.

* *Scenario one:* Use the _Troubleshooting guide_ to see if a solution to your problem is documented. The guide is organized by the major functions of the product.

+
With this scenario, you don't run the `must-gather` command before checking the guide.
+

For instance, if you are having trouble with creating a cluster, you might find a solution in the _Manage cluster_ section.
+

* *Scenario two:* Run the `must-gather` command and use the output to debug the issue.
+

* *Scenario three:* User runs `must-gather` to get info and share with Red Hat Support.

See the following procedure to start using the `must-gather` command:

. Learn about the `must-gather` command and install the prerequisites that you need at https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/support/gathering-cluster-data.html[Red Hat Openshift Container Platform: Gathering data].

. Log in to your hub cluster or log in to your managed cluster, whichever you need to troubleshoot.

. Add the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes image that is used for gathering data and the directory. Run the following command, where you insert the image and the directory for the output:

+
----
oc adm must-gather --image=<image-name> --dest-dir=<directory>
----

. Go to your specified directory to see your output, which is organized in the following manner:

 - Two peer levels: `cluster-scoped-resources` and `namespace` resources.
 - Sub-level for each: API group for the custom resource definitions for both cluster-scope and namespace-scoped resources.
 - Next level for each: YAML file sorted by `kind`.
