[#how-to-submit]
== How to submit a change

Because most changes need to be reviewed by development, doc, and QE, open a JIRA BUG with the suggestion and let the team make the changes after discussion:

*Prerequesite:* You need a JIRA account.

1. Go to https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ACM/CreateIssue!default.jspa[Create issue].
2. Choose `Bug` issue type.
3. Scroll down to `Component/s` and choose `Documentation`. The _Documentation Template_ appears in the description after this change.
4. Fill out all mandatory field in the template and the summary.
5. Click create.
6. If you send a simple PR for a typo or something similar, create your branch off of either the default branch we are currently working or the previous branch.

*Notes:*

- You can add fix versions and other labels you think might apply, but most of the other fields can be ignored.

- You can create a PR _ONLY_ if your change is small and requires no technical or grammatical debate. All PRs outside of a typo fix require an issue.

- You must create your own branch to create a pull request. The default stage branch will be the release we are currently working.

- The documentation source is in https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] format, and the content that is provided in PRs must conform to the AsciiDoc requirements. You can find some guidance for authoring in AsciiDoc in the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference].

[#how-issues-are-handled]
== How issues are handled

Your new issue goes into the _UNTRIAGED_ column on our JIRA board, where it will be assigned to the correct writer and a sprint. Incomplete templates will not be triaged.

Once the doc change from your issue is accepted, reviewed, and merged into the staging docs for that release, we will let you know in the issue comments and you or the team can close the issue.
