[#creating-custom-rules]
== Creating custom rules

You can create custom rules for the observability installation by adding Prometheus https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/[recording rules] and https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/[alerting rules] to the observability resource. For more information, see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/[Prometheus configuration].

** Recording rules provide you the ability to precalculate, or computate expensive expressions as needed. The results are saved as a new set of time series.
** Alerting rules provide you the ability to specify the alert conditions based on how an alert should be sent to an external service.

Define custom rules with Prometheus to create alert conditions, and send notifications to an external messaging service. *Note*: When you update your custom rules, `observability-thanos-rule` pods are restarted automatically.

Complete the following steps to create a custom rule: 

. Log in to your {product-title-short} hub cluster.
. Create a ConfigMap named `thanos-ruler-custom-rules` in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace. The key must be named, `custom_rules.yaml`, as shown in the following example. You can create multiple rules in the configuration:
+
* By default, the out-of-the-box alert rules are defined in the `thanos-ruler-default-rules` ConfigMap in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace. 
+
For example, you can create a custom alert rule that notifies you when your CPU usage passes your defined value. Your YAML might resemble the following content: 
+
----
data:
  custom_rules.yaml: |
    groups:
      - name: cluster-health
        rules:
        - alert: ClusterCPUHealth-jb
          annotations:
            summary: Notify when CPU utilization on a cluster is greater than the defined utilization limit
            description: "The cluster has a high CPU usage: {{ $value }} core for {{ $labels.cluster }} {{ $labels.clusterID }}."
          expr: |
            max(cluster:cpu_usage_cores:sum) by (clusterID, cluster, prometheus) > 0
          for: 5s
          labels:
            cluster: "{{ $labels.cluster }}"
            prometheus: "{{ $labels.prometheus }}"
            severity: critical
----

* You can also create a custom recording rule within the `thanos-ruler-custom-rules` ConfigMap.
+
For example, you can create a recording rule that provides you the ability to get the sum of the container memory cache of a pod. Your YAML might resemble the following content:
+
----
data:
  custom_rules.yaml: |
    groups:
      - name: container-memory
        rules:
        - record: pod:container_memory_cache:sum
          expr: sum(container_memory_cache{pod!=""}) BY (pod, container)
----
+
*Note*: If this is the first new custom rule, it is created immediately. For changes to the ConfigMap, the configuration is automatically reloaded. The configuration is reloaded due to the `config-reload` within the `observability-thanos-ruler` sidecar.

. If you want to verify that the alert rules is functioning appropriately, complete the following steps:
.. Access your Grafana dashboard and select the *Explore* icon.
.. In the _Metrics_ exploration bar, type in `ALERTS` and run the query. All the `ALERTS` that are currently in pending or initiating state in the system are displayed.
.. If your alert is not displayed, revisit the rule to see if the expression is accurate.

A custom rule is created.

[#configuring-rules-for-alertmanager]
== Configuring rules for AlertManager

Integrate external messaging tools such as email, Slack, and PagerDuty to receive notifications from AlertManager. You must override the `alertmanager-config` secret in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace to add integrations, and configure routes for AlertManager. Complete the following steps to update the custom receiver rules:

. Extract the data from the `alertmanager-config` secret. Run the following command:
+
----
oc -n open-cluster-management-observability get secret alertmanager-config --template='{{ index .data "alertmanager.yaml" }}' |base64 -d > alertmanager.yaml
----

. Edit and save the `alertmanager.yaml` file configuration by running the following command:
+
----
oc -n open-cluster-management-observability create secret generic alertmanager-config --from-file=alertmanager.yaml --dry-run -o=yaml |  oc -n open-cluster-management-observability replace secret --filename=-
----
+
Your updated secret might resemble the following content:
+
----
global
  smtp_smarthost: 'localhost:25'
  smtp_from: 'alertmanager@example.org'
  smtp_auth_username: 'alertmanager'
  smtp_auth_password: 'password'
templates: 
- '/etc/alertmanager/template/*.tmpl'
route:
  group_by: ['alertname', 'cluster', 'service']
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 3h 
  receiver: team-X-mails
  routes:
  - match_re:
      service: ^(foo1|foo2|baz)$
    receiver: team-X-mails
----

Your changes are applied immediately after it is modified. For an example of AlertManager, see https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/blob/master/doc/examples/simple.yml[prometheus/alertmanager].

[#adding-custom-metrics]
== Adding custom metrics

Add metrics to the `metrics_list.yaml` file, to be collected from managed clusters.

Complete the following steps to add custom metrics:

. Log in to your cluster.
. Verify that `mco observability` is enabled. Check for the following message in the `status.conditions.message` reads: `Observability components are deployed and running`. Run the following command:
+
----
oc get mco observability -o yaml
----

. Create a file named `observability-metrics-custom-allowlist.yaml` with the following content. Add the name and recording rule of the custom metric to the `metrics_list.yaml` parameter. For example, collect `node_memory_MemTotal_bytes` and `apiserver_request_duration_seconds:histogram_quantile_90` from your managed cluster. Your YAML for the ConfigMap might resemble the following content:
+
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: observability-metrics-custom-allowlist
data:
  metrics_list.yaml: |
    names:
      - node_memory_MemTotal_bytes
    rules:
    - record: apiserver_request_duration_seconds:histogram_quantile_90
      expr: histogram_quantile(0.90,sum(rate(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_bucket{job=\"apiserver\",
        verb!=\"WATCH\"}[5m])) by (verb,le))
----
+
** In the `names` section, add the name of the custom metrics that is to be collected from the managed cluster.
** In the `rules` section, enter only one value for the `expr` and `record` parameter pair to define the query expression. The metrics are collected as the name that is defined in the `record` parameter from your managed cluster. The metric value returned are the results after you run the query expression.
** The `names` and `rules` sections are optional. You can use either one or both of the sections.

. Create the `observability-metrics-custom-allowlist` ConfigMap in the 
`open-cluster-management-observability` namespace by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -n open-cluster-management-observability -f observability-metrics-custom-allowlist.yaml
----

. Verify that your custom metric is being collected from your managed clusters by viewing the metric on the Grafana dashboard. From your hub cluster, select the **Grafana dashboard** link.

. From the Grafana search bar, enter the metric that you want to view.
Data from your custom metric is collected.

. If the updated metrics is used in the Grafana dashboard, see xref:../observability/design_grafana.adoc#designing-your-grafana-dashboard[Designing your Grafana dashboard] to update your dashboard.

[#removing-default-metrics]
== Removing default metrics

If you want data to not be collected for a specific metric, you can remove the metric from the `observability-metrics-custom-allowlist.yaml` file. When you remove a metric, you are also deleting the metric. You can add the name of the default metric to the `metrics_list.yaml` parameter with a hyphen `-` at the start of the metric name.

Complete the following steps to delete default metrics:

. Log in to your cluster.
. Verify that `mco observability` is enabled. Check for the following message in the `status.conditions.message` reads: `Observability components are deployed and running`. Run the following command:
+
----
oc get mco observability -o yaml
----

. In the `observability-metrics-custom-allowlist.yaml` file, add the name of the default metric to the `metrics_list.yaml` parameter with a hyphen `-` at the start of the metric name. For example, add `-rest_client_requests_total` to the metric list. Your YAML for the ConfigMap might resemble the following content:
+
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: observability-metrics-custom-allowlist
data:
  metrics_list.yaml: |
    names:
      - node_memory_MemTotal_bytes
      - -rest_client_requests_total
----

. Create the `observability-metrics-custom-allowlist` ConfigMap in the 
`open-cluster-management-observability` namespace by running the following command:
+
----
oc apply -n open-cluster-management-observability -f observability-metrics-custom-allowlist.yaml
----

. Verify that your default metric is not being collected from your managed clusters by viewing the metric on the Grafana dashboard. From your hub cluster, select the **Grafana dashboard** link.

. From the Grafana search bar, enter the metric that you want to check.
Data from your default metric is no longer being collected.

. If the updated metrics is used in the Grafana dashboard, you can remove the metric from the ConfigMap. See xref:../observability/design_grafana.adoc#design-your-grafana-dashboard-with-configmap[Design your Grafana dashboard with a ConfigMap] to update your dashboard.

== Adding _advanced_ configuration

You can add the `advanced` configuration section to update the retention for each observability component. Complete the following steps:

. Log in to your cluster.
. Edit the `mco observability`. Run the following command:
+
----
oc edit mco observability -o yaml
----
. Add the `advanced` configuration into the `mco observability` YAML. Your YAML file might resemble the following contents:
+
----
spec:
  advanced:
    retentionConfig:
      blockDuration: 2h
      deleteDelay: 48h
      retentionInLocal: 24h
