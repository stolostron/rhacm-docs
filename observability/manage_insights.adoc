= Managing insight PolicyReports

{product-title} `PolicyReports` are violations that are generated by the `insights-client`. The `PolicyReports` are used to define and configure alerts that are sent to incident management systems. When there is a violation, alerts from a `PolicyReport` are sent to incident management system.

View the following sections to learn how to manage and view insight `PolicyReports`:

* <<viewing-vulnerabilities-insights,Viewing identified issues from the console>>

[#search-insight-policy-report-violation]
== Searching for insight policy reports

You can search for a specific insight `PolicyReport` that has a violation, across your managed clusters.

After you log into your {product-title-short} hub cluster, click the _Search_ icon in the console header to navigate to the _Search_ page. Enter the following query: `kind:policyreport`.

*Note*: The `PolicyReport` name matches the name of the cluster. 

You can also further specify your query by the insight policy violation and categories. When you select a `PolicyReport` name, you are redirected to the _Details_ page of the associated cluster. The _Insights_ sidebar is automatically displayed.

If the search service is disabled and you want to search for an insight, run the following command from your hub cluster:
+
----
oc get policyreport --all-namespaces
----

[#viewing-vulnerabilities-insights]
== Viewing identified issues from the console

You can view the identified issues on a specific cluster. 

After you log into your {product-title-short} cluster, select *Overview* from the navigation menu. Select a severity to view the `PolicyReports` that are associated with that severity. Details of the cluster issues and the severities are displayed from the _Cluster issues_ summary card.

Alternatively, you can select *Clusters* from the navigation menu. Select a managed cluster from the table to view more details. From the _Status_ card, view the number of identified issues.

Select the number of potential issues to view the severity chart and recommended remediations for the issues. Click the link to the vulnerability to view steps on _How to remediate_ and the _Reason_ for the vulnerability.

*Note*: After the issue is resolved, the Red Hat Insights are received by {product-title-short} every 30 minutes and Red Hat Insights is updated every two hours.

Be sure to verify which component sent the alert message from the `PolicyReport`. Navigate to the _Governance_ page and select a specific `policyreport`. Select the _Status_ tab and click the *View details* link to view the `PolicyReport` YAML file.

Locate the `source` parameter, which informs you of the component that sent the violation. The value options are `grc` and `insights`.
