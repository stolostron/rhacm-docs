[#obs-config]
= Observability configuration

When the observability service is enabled, the hub cluster is always configured to collect and send metrics to the configured Thanos instance, regardless of whether hub self-management is enabled or not. When the hub cluster is self-managed, the `disableHubSelfManagement` parameter is set to `false`, which is the default setting. The `multiclusterhub-operator` enables the `multicluster-observability-operator` pod by default. You must configure the `multicluster-observability-operator` pod.

Metrics and alerts for the hub cluster appear in the `local-cluster` namespace. The `local-cluster` is only available if hub self-management is enabled. You can query the `local-cluster` metrics in the Grafana explorer. Continue reading to understand what metrics you can collect with the observability component, and for information about the observability pod capacity.

[#metric-types]
== Metric types

By default, {ocp-short} sends metrics to Red Hat using the Telemetry service. The `acm_managed_cluster_info` is available with {acm-short} and is included with telemetry, but is _not_ displayed on the {acm-short} _Observe environments overview_ dashboard.

View the following table of metric types that are supported by the framework:
