= Observability architecture

The observability service can be used to get a status and metrics for your hub cluster and managed clusters. When you enable observability, the `multicluster-observability-operator` pod is deployed by the `multiclusterhub-operator` automatically to each imported or created cluster.

//didn't see the endpoint-operator in the diagram, is this pod still relevant? 

//is the endpoint operator the same as the observaility add-on controller? 
//When the service is enabled, the `observability-endpoint-operator` is automatically deployed to each imported or created cluster. This controller collects the data from {ocp} Prometheus, then sends it to the {product-title-short} hub cluster. If the hub cluster imports itself as the `local-cluster`, observability is also enabled on it and metrics are collected from the hub cluster.

//The observability component deploys an instance of Prometheus Alertmanager, which enables alerts to be forwarded with third-party applications. It also includes an instance of Grafana to enable data visualization with dashboards (static) or data exploration. {product-title-short} supports version 8.5.20 of Grafana. You can also design your Grafana dashboard. For more information, see _Designing your Grafana dashboard_. You can customize the observability service by creating custom recording rules or alerting rules.

//should we add the supported version for Alertmanager?
//might need to update the diagram, if yes a request needs to be submitted

The components of the observability architecture include the following items:

- The multicluster hub operator (`multiclusterhub-operator` pod) deploys the `multicluster-observability-operator` pod. It sends hub cluster data to your managed clusters.

- The _observability add-on controller_ is the API server that automatically updates the log of the managed cluster.

- The observability component deploys an instance of _Grafana_ to enable data visualization with dashboards (static) or data exploration. {product-title-short} supports version 8.5.20 of Grafana. You can also design your Grafana dashboard. For more information, see _Designing your Grafana dashboard_.

- The _Prometheus Alertmanager_ enables alerts to be forwarded with third-party applications. You can customize the observability service by creating custom recording rules or alerting rules.
