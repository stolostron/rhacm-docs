[#metric-types]
== Metric types

By default, {ocp-short} sends metrics to Red Hat using the Telemetry service. The `acm_managed_cluster_info` is available with {product-title-short} and is included with telemetry, but is _not_ displayed on the {product-title-short} _Observe environments overview_ dashboard.

View the following table of metric types that are supported by the framework:
