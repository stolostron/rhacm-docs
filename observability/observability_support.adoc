[#observability-support]
= Support

- {product-title-short} is tested with and fully supported by Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, formerly {ocp}. 

- {product-title-short} supports the function of the multicluster observability operator on user-provided third-party object storage that is S3 API compatible. The observability service uses Thanos supported, stable object stores.

- {product-title-short} support efforts include reasonable efforts to identify root causes. If you open a support ticket and the root cause is the customer-provided S3 compatible object storage, then you must open an issue using the customer support channels.

- {product-title-short} does not commit to fix support tickets raised by customers, where the root cause identified is the S3 compatible object storage provider.
