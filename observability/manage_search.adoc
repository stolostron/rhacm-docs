[#creating-search-configurable-collection]
== Creating search configurable collection

Create the `search-collector-config` config map to define which Kubernetes resources get collected from the cluster by listing the resources in the allow and deny list section. List the resources in the `data.AllowedResources` and `data.DeniedResources` sections within the config map. Run the following command to create the resource:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f yourconfigMapFile.yaml
----

Your config map might resemble the following YAML file: 

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
 name: search-collector-config
 namespace: <namespace where search-collector add-on is deployed>
data:
 AllowedResources: |-
   - apiGroups:
       - "*"
     resources:
       - services
       - pods
   - apiGroups:
       - admission.k8s.io
       - authentication.k8s.io
     resources:
       - "*"
 DeniedResources: |-
   - apiGroups:
       - "*"
     resources:
       - secrets
   - apiGroups:
       - admission.k8s.io
     resources:
       - policies
       - iampolicies
       - certificatepolicies
----

The previous config map example allows `services` and `pods` to be collected from all `apiGroups`, while allowing all resources to be collected from the `admission.k8s.io` and `authentication.k8s.io` `apiGroups`. At the same time, the config map example also prevents the central collection of `secrets` from all `apiGroups` while preventing the collection of `policies`, `iampolicies`, and `certificatepolicies` from the `apiGroup` `admission.k8s.io`.

*Note:* If you do not provide a config map, all resources are collected by default. If you only provide `AllowedResources`, all resources not listed in `AllowedResources` are automatically excluded. Resources listed in `AllowedResources` and `DeniedResources` at the same time are also  excluded. 

[#customizing-search-console]
== Customizing the search console

Customize your search results and limits. Complete the following tasks to help with customization:

. Customize the search result limit from the {ocp-short} console.
.. Update the `console-mce-config` in the `multicluster-engine` namespace. These settings apply to all users and might affect performance. View the following performance parameter descriptions:
+
- `SAVED_SEARCH_LIMIT` - The maximum amount of saved searches per user. By default, there is a limit of ten saved searches for each user. The default value is `10`. To update the limit, add the following key value to the `console-config` config map: `SAVED_SEARCH_LIMIT: x`.
- `SEARCH_RESULT_LIMIT` - The maximum amount of search results displayed in the console. Default value is `1000`. To remove this limit set to `-1`.
- `SEARCH_AUTOCOMPLETE_LIMIT` - The maximum number of suggestions retrieved for the search bar typeahead. Default value is `10,000`. To remove this limit set to `-1`.

.. Run the following `patch` command from the {ocp-short} console to change the search result to 100 items:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc patch configmap console-mce-config -n multicluster-engine --type merge -p '{"data":{"SEARCH_RESULT_LIMIT":"100"}}'
----

. To add, edit, or remove suggested searches, create a config map named `console-search-config` and configure the `suggestedSearches` section. Suggested searches that are listed are also displayed from the console. It is required to have an `id, name, and searchText` for each search onject. View the following config map example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: console-search-config
  namespace: open-cluster-management
data:
  suggestedSearches: |-
    [
      {
        "id": "search.suggested.workloads.name",
        "name": "Workloads",
        "description": "Show workloads running on your fleet",
        "searchText": "kind:DaemonSet,Deployment,Job,StatefulSet,ReplicaSet"
      },
      {
        "id": "search.suggested.unhealthy.name",
        "name": "Unhealthy pods",
        "description": "Show pods with unhealthy status",
        "searchText": "kind:Pod status:Pending,Error,Failed,Terminating,ImagePullBackOff,CrashLoopBackOff,RunContainerError,ContainerCreating"
      },
      {
        "id": "search.suggested.createdLastHour.name",
        "name": "Created last hour",
        "description": "Show resources created within the last hour",
        "searchText": "created:hour"
      },
      {
        "id": "search.suggested.virtualmachines.name",
        "name": "Virtual Machines",
        "description": "Show virtual machine resources",
        "searchText": "kind:VirtualMachine"
      }
    ]

[#querying-in-the-console]
== Querying in the console

You can type any text value in the _Search box_ and results include anything with that value from any property, such as a name or namespace. Queries that contain an empty space are not supported.

For more specific search results, include the property selector in your search. You can combine related values for the property for a more precise scope of your search. For example, search for `cluster:dev red` to receive results that match the string "red" in the `dev` cluster. 

Complete the following steps to make queries with search:

. Click *Search* in the navigation menu.
. Type a word in the _Search box_, then Search finds your resources that contain that value.
- As you search for resources, you receive other resources that are related to your original search result, which help you visualize how the resources interact with other resources in the system.
- Search returns and lists each cluster with the resource that you search.
For resources in the _hub_ cluster, the cluster name is displayed as _local-cluster_.
- Your search results are grouped by `kind`, and each resource `kind` is grouped in a table.
- Your search options depend on your cluster objects.
- You can refine your results with specific labels.
Search is case-sensitive when you query labels.
See the following examples that you can select for filtering: `name`, `namespace`, `status`, and other resource fields. Auto-complete provides suggestions to refine your search. See the following example:
+
- Search for a single field, such as `kind:pod` to find all pod resources.
- Search for multiple fields, such as `kind:pod namespace:default` to find the pods in the default namespace.
+
*Notes:*
+
** When you search for more than one property selector with multiple values, the search returns either of the values that were queried. View the following examples:
** When you search for `kind:Pod name:a`, any pod named `a` is returned.
** When you search for `kind:Pod name:a,b`, any pod named `a` or `b` are returned.
** Search for `kind:pod status:!Running` to find all pod resources where the status is not `Running`.
** Search for `kind:pod restarts:>1` to find all pods that restarted at least twice.
. If you want to save your search, click the *Save search* icon.
. To download your search results, select the *Export as CSV* button.

[#updating-klusterlet-addons-managed]
== Updating klusterlet-addon-search deployments on managed clusters

To collect the Kubernetes objects from the managed clusters, the `klusterlet-addon-search` pod is run on all the managed clusters where search is enabled. This deployment is run in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace. A managed cluster with a high number of resources might require more memory for the `klusterlet-addon-search` deployment to function.

Resource requirements for the `klusterlet-addon-search` pod in a managed cluster can be specified in the `ManagedClusterAddon` custom resource in your {product-title-short} hub cluster. There is a namespace for each managed cluster with the managed cluster name. Complete the following steps:

. Edit the `ManagedClusterAddon` custom resource from the namespace matching the managed cluster name. Run the following command to update the resource requirement in `xyz` managed cluster:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc edit managedclusteraddon search-collector -n xyz
----

. Append the resource requirements as annotations. View the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  annotations: addon.open-cluster-management.io/search_memory_limit: 2048Mi
  addon.open-cluster-management.io/search_memory_request: 512Mi
----

The annotation overrides the resource requirements on the managed clusters and automatically restarts the pod with new resource requirements.

*Note:* You can discover all resources defined in your managed cluster by using the API Explorer in the console. Alternatively, you can discover all resources by running the following command: `oc api-resources`
