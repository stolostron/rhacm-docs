[#setting-up-the-grafana-developer-instance]
== Setting up the Grafana developer instance

First, clone the https://github.com/stolostron/multicluster-observability-operator[`stolostron/multicluster-observability-operator/`] repository, so that you are able to run the scripts that are in the `tools` folder. Complete the following steps to set up the Grafana developer instance:

. Run the `setup-grafana-dev.sh` to setup your Grafana instance. When you run the script the following resources are created: `secret/grafana-dev-config`, `deployment.apps/grafana-dev`, `service/grafana-dev`, `ingress.extensions/grafana-dev`, `persistentvolumeclaim/grafana-dev`:
+
----
./setup-grafana-dev.sh --deploy
secret/grafana-dev-config created
deployment.apps/grafana-dev created
service/grafana-dev created
ingress.extensions/grafana-dev created
persistentvolumeclaim/grafana-dev created
----

. Switch the user role to Grafana administrator with the `switch-to-grafana-admin.sh` script.
+
.. Select the Grafana URL, `https://$ACM_URL/grafana-dev/` and log in.
.. Then run the following command to add the switched user as Grafana administrator. For example, after you log in using `kubeadmin`, run following command:
+
----
./switch-to-grafana-admin.sh kube:admin
User <kube:admin> switched to be grafana admin
----

The Grafana developer instance is set up. 

[#design-your-grafana-dashboard]
== Design your Grafana dashboard

After you set up the Grafana instance, you can design the dashboard. Complete the following steps to refresh the Grafana console and design your dashboard:

. From the Grafana console, create a dashboard by selecting the *Create* icon from the navigation panel. Select *Dashboard*, and then click *Add new panel*.

. From the _New Dashboard/Edit Panel_ view, navigate to the _Query_ tab.

. Configure your query by selecting `Observatorium` from the data source selector and enter a PromQL query.

. From the Grafana dashboard header, click the *Save* icon that is in the dashboard header.

. Add a descriptive name and click *Save*. 

[#design-your-grafana-dashboard-with-configmap]
=== Design your Grafana dashboard with a ConfigMap

Complete the following steps to design your Grafana dashboard with a ConfigMap:

. You can use the `generate-dashboard-configmap-yaml.sh` script to generate the dashboard ConfigMap, and to save the ConfigMap locally:
+
----
./generate-dashboard-configmap-yaml.sh "Your Dashboard Name"
Save dashboard <your-dashboard-name> to ./your-dashboard-name.yaml
----
+
If you do not have permissions to run the previously mentioned script, complete the following steps:
+
.. Select a dashboard and click the *Dashboard settings* icon. 
.. Click the *JSON Model* icon from the navigation panel.
.. Copy the dashboard JSON data and paste it in the `_data_` section.
.. Modify the `_name_` and replace `_$your-dashboard-name_`. Your ConfigMap might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: $your-dashboard-name
  namespace: open-cluster-management-observability
  labels:
    grafana-custom-dashboard: "true"
data:
  $your-dashboard-name.json: |-
    $your_dashboard_json
----
+
*Note:* If your dashboard is not in the _General_ folder, you can specify the folder name in the `annotations` section of this ConfigMap:
+
----
annotations:
  observability.open-cluster-management.io/dashboard-folder: Custom
----
+
After you complete your updates for the ConfigMap, you can install it to import the dashboard to the Grafana instance.

[#uninstalling-the-grafana-developer-instance]
== Uninstalling the Grafana developer instance

When you uninstall the instance, the related resources are also deleted. Run the following command:

----
./setup-grafana-dev.sh --clean
secret "grafana-dev-config" deleted
deployment.apps "grafana-dev" deleted
service "grafana-dev" deleted
ingress.extensions "grafana-dev" deleted
persistentvolumeclaim "grafana-dev" deleted
----
