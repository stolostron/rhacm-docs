[#setting-up-the-grafana-developer-instance]
== Setting up the Grafana developer instance

First, clone the https://github.com/stolostron/multicluster-observability-operator[`stolostron/multicluster-observability-operator/`] repository, so that you are able to run the scripts that are in the `tools` folder. Be sure to use the most current `grafana-dev` instance.

Complete the following steps to set up the Grafana developer instance:

. Run the `setup-grafana-dev.sh` to setup your Grafana instance. When you run the script the following resources are created: `secret/grafana-dev-config`, `deployment.apps/grafana-dev`, `service/grafana-dev`, `ingress.extensions/grafana-dev`, `persistentvolumeclaim/grafana-dev`:
+
----
./setup-grafana-dev.sh --deploy
secret/grafana-dev-config created
deployment.apps/grafana-dev created
service/grafana-dev created
serviceaccount/grafana-dev created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/open-cluster-management:grafana-crb-dev created
route.route.openshift.io/grafana-dev created
persistentvolumeclaim/grafana-dev created
oauthclient.oauth.openshift.io/grafana-proxy-client-dev created
deployment.apps/grafana-dev patched
service/grafana-dev patched
route.route.openshift.io/grafana-dev patched
oauthclient.oauth.openshift.io/grafana-proxy-client-dev patched
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/open-cluster-management:grafana-crb-dev patched
----

. Switch the user role to Grafana administrator with the `switch-to-grafana-admin.sh` script.
+
.. Select the Grafana URL, `https://grafana-dev-open-cluster-management-observability.{OPENSHIFT_INGRESS_DOMAIN}`, and log in.
.. Then run the following command to add the switched user as Grafana administrator. For example, after you log in using `kubeadmin`, run following command:
+
----
./switch-to-grafana-admin.sh kube:admin
User <kube:admin> switched to be grafana admin
----

The Grafana developer instance is set up. 

[#design-your-dashboard]
== Designing your Grafana dashboard

After you set up the Grafana instance, you can design the dashboard. Complete the following steps to refresh the Grafana console and design your dashboard:

. From the Grafana console, create a dashboard by selecting the *Create* icon from the navigation panel. Select *Dashboard*, and then click *Add new panel*.

. From the _New Dashboard/Edit Panel_ view, navigate to the _Query_ tab.

. Configure your query by selecting `Observatorium` from the data source selector and enter a PromQL query.

. From the Grafana dashboard header, click the *Save* icon that is in the dashboard header.

. Add a descriptive name and click *Save*. 

[#designing-your-grafana-dashboard-with-configmap]
=== Designing your Grafana dashboard with a ConfigMap

Complete the following steps to design your Grafana dashboard with a ConfigMap:

. You can use the `generate-dashboard-configmap-yaml.sh` script to generate the dashboard ConfigMap, and to save the ConfigMap locally:
+
----
./generate-dashboard-configmap-yaml.sh "Your Dashboard Name"
Save dashboard <your-dashboard-name> to ./your-dashboard-name.yaml
----
+
If you do not have permissions to run the previously mentioned script, complete the following steps:
+
.. Select a dashboard and click the *Dashboard settings* icon. 
.. Click the *JSON Model* icon from the navigation panel.
.. Copy the dashboard JSON data and paste it in the `_data_` section.
.. Modify the `_name_` and replace `_$your-dashboard-name_`. Enter a universally unique identifier (UUID) in the `uid` field in `data.$your-dashboard-name.json.$$your_dashboard_json`. You can use a program such as link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/uuidgen.1.html[uuidegen] to create a UUID. Your ConfigMap might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: $your-dashboard-name
  namespace: open-cluster-management-observability
  labels:
    grafana-custom-dashboard: "true"
data:
  $your-dashboard-name.json: |-
    $your_dashboard_json
----
+
*Note:* If your dashboard is not in the _General_ folder, you can specify the folder name in the `annotations` section of this ConfigMap:
+
----
annotations:
  observability.open-cluster-management.io/dashboard-folder: Custom
----
+
After you complete your updates for the ConfigMap, you can install it to import the dashboard to the Grafana instance.

[#using-managed-cluster-labels]
== Using managed cluster labels in Grafana

When observability is enabled in the hub cluster, the `observability-managed-cluster-label-allowlist` ConfigMap is created in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace. The ConfigMap contains a list of managed cluster labels maintained by the `observabilty-rbac-query-proxy` pod, to populate a list of label names to filter from within the _ACM - Cluster Overview_ Grafana dashboard. By default, bservability ignores a subset of labels in the `observability-managed-cluster-label-allowlist` ConfigMap.

When a cluster is imported into the managed cluster fleet or modified, the `observability-rbac-query-proxy` pod watches for any changes in reference to the managed cluster labels and automatically updates the `observability-managed-cluster-label-allowlist` ConfigMap to reflect the changes. The ConfigMap contains only unique label names, which are either included in the `ignore_labels` or `labels` list. Your `observability-managed-cluster-label-allowlist` ConfigMap might resemble the following YAML file:

[source,yaml]
----
data:
  managed_cluster.yaml: |
    ignore_labels:
      - clusterID
      - cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-application-manager
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-cert-policy-controller
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-cluster-proxy
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-config-policy-controller
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-governance-policy-framework
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-iam-policy-controller
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-observability-controller
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-search-collector
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-work-manager
      - installer.name
      - installer.namespace
      - local-cluster
      - name
    labels:
      - cloud
      - vendor
----

The labels that are enabled are displayed in the drop-down filter on the _ACM - Clusters Overview_ Grafana dashboard. The values are from the `acm_managed_cluster_labels` metric, depending on the `label` key value that is selected.

Any label that is listed in the `ignore_labels` keylist of the ConfigMap is removed from the drop-down filter on the _ACM - Clusters Overview_ Grafana dashboard.


[#adding-managed-cluster-labels]
=== Adding managed cluster labels

When you add a managed cluster label to the `observability-managed-cluster-label-allowlist` ConfigMap, the label becomes available as a filter option in Grafana. Add a unique label to the hub cluster, or managed cluster object that is associated with the managed cluster fleet. For example, if you add the label, `department=finance` to a managed cluster, the ConfigMap is updated and might resemble the following changes:

[source,yaml]
----
data:
  managed_cluster.yaml: |
    ignore_labels:
      - clusterID
      - cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-application-manager
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-cert-policy-controller
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-cluster-proxy
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-config-policy-controller
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-governance-policy-framework
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-iam-policy-controller
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-observability-controller
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-search-collector
      - feature.open-cluster-management.io/addon-work-manager
      - installer.name
      - installer.namespace
      - local-cluster
      - name
    labels:
      - cloud
      - department
      - vendor
----

[#enabling-managed-cluster-labels]
=== Enabling managed cluster labels

Enable a managed cluster label that is already disabled by removing the label from the `ignore_labels` list in the `observability-managed-cluster-label-allowlist` ConfigMap.

For example, enable the `local-cluster` and `name` labels. Your `observability-managed-cluster-label-allowlist` ConfigMap might resemble the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
data:
  managed_cluster.yaml: |
    ignore_labels:
      - clusterID
      - installer.name
      - installer.namespace
    labels:
      - cloud
      - vendor
      - local-cluster
      - name
----

The ConfigMap resyncs after 30 seconds to ensure that the cluster labels are updated. After you update the ConfigMap, check the `observability-rbac-query-proxy` pod logs in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace to verify where the label is listed. The following information might be displayed in the pod log:

----
enabled managedcluster labels: <label>
----

//is there a command to run for this verification? 

From the Grafana dashboard, verify that the label is listed as a value in the _Label_ drop-down menu.

[#disabling-managed-cluster-labels]
=== Disabling managed cluster labels

Exclude a managed cluster label from being listed in the _Label_ drop-down filter. Add the label name to the `ignore_labels` list. For example, your YAML might resemble the following file if you add `local-cluster` and `name` back into the `ignore_labels` list:

[source,yaml]
----
data:
  managed_cluster.yaml: |
    ignore_labels:
      - clusterID
      - installer.name
      - installer.namespace
      - local-cluster
      - name
    labels:
      - cloud
      - vendor
----

Check the `observability-rbac-query-proxy` pod logs in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace to verify where the label is listed. The following information might be displayed in the pod log:

----
disabled managedcluster label: <label>
----

[#uninstalling-the-grafana-developer-instance]
== Uninstalling the Grafana developer instance

When you uninstall the instance, the related resources are also deleted. Run the following command:

----
./setup-grafana-dev.sh --clean
