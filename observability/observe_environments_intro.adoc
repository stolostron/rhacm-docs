= Observability service

//Why is Observability important on a multi-cluster level?

The observability component is a service you can use to understand the health and utilization of clusters and your workloads across your fleet. By using the observability service, you are able to automate and manage the components that are within observability. By default, multicluster observability operator is enabled during the installation of {acm-short}.


//ACM Observability and what it brings to the table (big highlight on cost savings here)
// I need help with understanding the cost savings, how does observability help the user save costs?

When you enable the observability service, the `observability-endpoint-operator` is automatically deployed to each imported or created managed cluster. This controller starts a metrics collector that collects the data from {ocp} Prometheus, then sends the data to the {acm-short} hub cluster.

//== Observability open source components

//What other open source components are being used? The only thing mentioned was Thanos. Is Alertmanager and Prometheus also open source?
