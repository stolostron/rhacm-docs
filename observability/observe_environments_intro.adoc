= Observability service introduction

Observability can help you identify and assess performance problems without additional tests and support. The {acm} observability component is a service you can use to understand the health and utilization of clusters, and workloads across your fleet. By using the observability service, you are able to automate and manage the components that are within observability.

Observability service uses existing and widely-adopted observability tools from the open source community. By default, multicluster observability operator is enabled during the installation of {acm-short}. Thanos is deployed within the hub cluster for long-term metrics storage. The `observability-endpoint-operator` is automatically deployed to each imported or created managed cluster. This controller starts a metrics collector that collects the data from {ocp} Prometheus, then sends the data to the {acm-short} hub cluster.
