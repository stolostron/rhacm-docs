The observability component is a service you can use to understand the state of your clusters. The observability service is deployed by the `multiclusterhub-operator` pod, which is complete during the {product-title-short} installation. By default, observability is enabled on your hub cluster.

//from observe_environments.adoc
You can use {product-title} to gain insight and optimize your managed clusters. Enable the observability service operator, `multicluster-observability-operator`, on your hub cluster to monitor the health of your managed clusters. Learn about the architecture for the multicluster observability service in the following sections.



*Note:* The _on-demand log_ provides access for engineers to get logs for a given pod in real-time. Logs from the hub cluster are not aggregated. These logs can be accessed with the search service and other parts of the console.


With the observability service enabled, you can use {product-title} to gain insight about and optimize your managed clusters. This information can save cost and prevent unnecessary events.
