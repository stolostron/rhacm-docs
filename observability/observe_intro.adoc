= Observing environments

You can use {product-title} to gain insight and optimize your managed clusters. Enable the observability service operator, `multicluster-observability-operator`, to monitor the health of your managed clusters. Learn about the architecture for the multicluster observability service in the following sections.

[#observability-service]
== Observability service

By default, observability is included with the product installation, but not enabled. Due to the requirement for persistent storage, the observability service is not enabled by default. {product-title-short} supports the following stable object stores:

- Amazon S3 (or other S3 compatible object stores like Ceph)
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure storage

When the service is enabled the `observability-endpoint-controller` is automatically deployed to each imported or created cluster. This controller collects the data from {ocp} Prometheus, then sends it to the {product-title-short} hub cluster. 

*Note*: In {product-title-short} the `metrics-collector` is only supported for {ocp} 4.x clusters. 

The observability service deploys an instance of Prometheus AlertManager, which enables alerts to be forwarded with third-party applications. It also includes an instance of Grafana to enable data visualization via dashboards (static) or data exploration. 

You can customize the observability service by creating custom link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/[recording rules] or link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/[alerting rules].

For more information about enabling observability, see link:../observability/observability_install.adoc#enable-observability[Enable observability service].

=== Observe environments Overview page

You can view the following information about your clusters on the _Overview_ dashboard:

* Metric data from your managed clusters by selecting the Grafana link 
* Cluster, node, and pod counts across all clusters and for each provider
* Cluster status
* Cluster compliance
* Pod status

Many clickable elements on the dashboard open a search for related resources. Click on a provider card to view information for clusters from a single provider. You can personalize your view of the _Overview_ dashboard by clicking and dragging to reorganize the cards.
