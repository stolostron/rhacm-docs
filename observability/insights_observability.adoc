[#rh-insights]
= Observability with Red Hat Insights

Red Hat Insights is integrated with {product-title-short} observability, and is enabled to help identify existing or potential problems in your clusters. Red Hat Insights helps you to identify, prioritize, and resolve stability, performance, network, and security risks. {ocp} offers cluster health monitoring through OpenShift Cluster Manager. OpenShift Cluster Manager collects anonymized, aggregrated information about the health, usage, and size of the clusters. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_insights/2021/[Red Hat Insights product documentation].

When you create or import an OpenShift cluster, anonymized data from your managed cluster is automatically sent to Red Hat. This information is used to create insights, which provide cluster health information. {product-title-short} administrator can use this health information to create alerts based on severity.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

The _Identified issues_ status displays the number of issues by severity. The triage levels used for the issues are the following severity categories: _Critical_, _Major_, _Low_, and _Warning_. 

* After you click the number, the _Potential issue_ side panel is displayed. A summary and chart of the total issues are displayed in the panel. You can also use the search feature to search for recommended remediations. The remediation option displays the _Description_ of the vulnerability, _Category_ that vulnerability is associated with, and the _Total risk_.

* From the _Description_ section, you can select the link to the vulnerability. View steps to resolve your vulnerabilty by selecting the _How to remediate_ tab. You can also view why the vulnerability occurred by clicking the _Reason_ tab.
