[#search-in-the-console]
= Search in the console

For {product-title}, search provides visibility into your Kubernetes resources across all of your clusters. Search indexes the Kubernetes resources and the relationships to other resources. You can use the `searchcustomization` custom resource (CR) to define the storage settings for search persistence if you want to change the storage class and storage size.

[#search-components]
== Search components

The search architecture is composed of the following components:
//is there a specific name for the REST API?
- `search-collector`: Watches the Kubernetes resources, collects the resource metadata, and sends the collected data to the `search-indexer` process using the REST API. The `search-collector` also computes relationships for resources within the managed cluster and sends it to the `search-indexer`.

- `search-indexer`: Receives data from the collectors through the REST API and writes to PostgreSQL database. The `search-aggregator` also watches resources in the hub cluster, to keep track of active managed clusters.

- `search-api`: Provides access to the data in the `search-index` through GraphQL and enforces role-based access control.

- `search-postgress`: Stores collected data from all managed clusters in an instance of the PostgresQL database.

Search is enabled by default. Search is also enabled when you provision, or manually import a managed cluster. If you want to disable search on your managed cluster, see link:../clusters/modify_endpoint.adoc#modifying-the-klusterlet-add-ons-settings-of-your-cluster[Modifying the klusterlet add-ons settings of your cluster] for more information.

[#search-customization]
== Search customization

When you install {product-title-short}, the product is configured to persist the data in-memory to a file system. The `StatefulSet` `search-redisgraph` deploys the Redisgraph pod, which mounts the persistent volume named `persist`. If your cluster has a defined default storage class, the search component creates a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) of 10Gi on the default storage class. If a default storage class does not exist in your cluster, search saves the index in an empty directory (`emptyDir`).

You can customize the storage settings for search by creating the `searchcustomization` CR. Search customization is namespace-scoped and located where search is installed in the hub cluster. View the following example of the search customization CR:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: search.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: SearchCustomization
metadata:
  name: searchcustomization
  namespace: open-cluster-management
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: ""
spec:
  persistence: true
  storageClass: gp2
  storageSize: 12Gi
