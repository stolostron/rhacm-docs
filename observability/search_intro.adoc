= Searching in the console introduction

For {product-title}, search provides visibility into your Kubernetes resources across all of your clusters. Search indexes the Kubernetes resources and the relationships to other resources. You can use the `searchcustomization` custom resource (CR) to define the storage settings for search persistence if you want to change the storage class and storage size.

[#search-components]
== Search components

The search architecture is composed of the following components:

//check 'within' vs 'among'

- `search-collector`: Watches the Kubernetes resources, collects the resource metadata, and sends the collected data to the `search-indexer`. The `search-collector` also computes relationships for resources within the managed cluster and sends it to the `search-indexer`.

- `search-indexer`: Receives resource metadata from the collectors and writes to PostgreSQL database. The `search-indexer` also watches resources in the hub cluster to keep track of active managed clusters.

- `search-api`: Provides access to all cluster data in the `search-indexer` through GraphQL and enforces role-based access control (RBAC).

- `search-postgres`: Stores collected data from all managed clusters in an instance of the PostgreSQL database.

Search is configured by default on the hub cluster. When you provision or manually import a managed cluster, the `klusterlet-addon-search` is enabled. If you want to disable search on your managed cluster, see link:../add-ons/modify_endpoint.adoc#modifying-the-klusterlet-add-ons-settings-of-your-cluster[Modifying the klusterlet add-ons settings of your cluster] for more information.

[#search-customization]
== Search customization and configurations

You can modify the default values in the `search-v2-operator` custom resource. To view details of the custom resource, run the following command:

----
oc get search search-v2-operator -o yaml
----

The search operator watches the `search-v2-operator` custom resource, reconciles the changes and updates active pods. View the following descriptions of the configurations:

- PostgreSQL database storage: 
+
When you install {product-title-short}, the PostgreSQL database is configured to persist the search data in an empty directory (`emptyDir`) volume. You can back up the PostgreSQL data on a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to improve search performance. You can select a storageclass from your {product-title-short} hub cluster to back up your search data. For example, if you select the `gp2` storageclass your configuration might resemble the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: search.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: Search
metadata:
  name: search-v2-operator
  namespace: open-cluster-management
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: ""
spec:
  dbStorage:
  size: 10Gi
  storageClassName: gp2
----
+
This confirguration creates a PVC named `gp2-search` and is mounted to the `search-postgres` pod. By default, the storage size is `10Gi`. You can modify the storage size. For example, `20Gi` might be sufficient for about 200 managed clusters.

- PostgreSQL database configuration:
+
PostgreSQL supports database tuning to optimize your database performance. The tuning configurations can be specified using a ConfigMap. This ConfigMap contains the name-value pairs for the supported tuning parameters. See the following example command to create a ConfigMap with tuning parameters:
+
----
oc create configmap tuning-config --from-literal POSTGRESQL_SHARED_BUFFERS=128MB --from-literal POSTGRESQL_EFFECTIVE_CACHE_SIZE=128MB --from-literal WORK_MEM=64MB
----
+
- Optimize PostgreSQL database configuration by using the previous ConfigMap. For example, add `tuning-config` as the parameter value: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: search.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: Search
metadata:
  name: search-v2-operator
  namespace: open-cluster-management
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: ""
spec:
  dbConfig: tuning-config
  dbStorage:
  size: 10Gi
  storageClassName: gp2-search
----
+
- Optimize cost by tuning the pod memory requirements, replica count, and update log levels for active pods. Update the `deployment` section of the `search-v2-operator` custom resource. There are four deployments managed by the `search-v2-operator`, which can be updated individually. Your `search-v2-operator` custom resource might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: search.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: Search
metadata:
  name: search-v2-operator
  namespace: open-cluster-management
spec:
  dbConfig: tuning-config
    deployments:
      collector:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 128Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 250m
          memory: 64Mi
        indexer:
        replicaCount: 3
----

- Node placement for search pods:
+
You can update the `Placement` of search pods by using the `nodeSelector` parameter, or the `tolerations` parameter. View the following example configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
    dbStorage:
      size: 10Gi
    deployments:
      collector: {}
      database: {}
      indexer: {}
      queryapi: {}
    tolerations:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
      operator: Exists
