[#search-console-intro]
= Search in the console

For {acm}, search provides visibility into your Kubernetes resources across all of your clusters. Search also indexes the Kubernetes resources and the relationships to other resources.

[#search-components]
== Search components

The search architecture is composed of the following components:

.Search component table
|===
| Component name | Metrics | Metric type |Description 

| `search-collector`
| 
| 
| Watches the Kubernetes resources, collects the resource metadata, computes relationships for resources across all of your managed clusters, and sends the collected data to the `search-indexer`. The `search-collector` on your managed cluster runs as a pod named, `klusterlet-addon-search`.

.4+| `search-indexer`

Receives resource metadata from the collectors and writes to PostgreSQL database. The `search-indexer` also watches resources in the hub cluster to keep track of active managed clusters.

| `search_indexer_request_duration`
| Histogram
| Time (seconds) the search indexer takes to process a request (from managed cluster).

| `search_indexer_request_size`
| Histogram
| Total changes (add, update, delete) in the search indexer request (from managed cluster).

| `search_indexer_request_count`
| Counter
| Total requests received by the search indexer (from managed clusters).

| `search_indexer_requests_in_flight`
| Gauge
| Total requests the search indexer is processing at a given time.

.3+| `search-api`

Provides access to all cluster data in the `search-indexer` through GraphQL and enforces role-based access control (RBAC).

| `search_api_requests` 
| Histogram
| Histogram of HTTP requests duration in seconds.

| `search_dbquery_duration_seconds`
| Histogram
| Latency of database requests in seconds.

| `search_api_db_connection_failed_total`
| Counter
| The total number of database connection attempts that failed.

| `search-postgres`
| 
|
| Stores collected data from all managed clusters in an instance of the PostgreSQL database.
|===

Search is configured by default on the hub cluster. When you provision or manually import a managed cluster, the `klusterlet-addon-search` is enabled. If you want to disable search on your managed cluster, see link:../add-ons/modify_endpoint.adoc#modifying-the-klusterlet-add-ons-settings-of-your-cluster[Modifying the klusterlet add-ons settings of your cluster] for more information.

[#search-customization]
== Search customization and configurations

You can modify the default values in the `search-v2-operator` custom resource. To view details of the custom resource, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
oc get search search-v2-operator -o yaml
----

The search operator watches the `search-v2-operator` custom resource, reconciles the changes and updates active pods. View the following descriptions of the configurations:

- PostgreSQL database storage: 
+
When you install {acm-short}, the PostgreSQL database is configured to save the PostgreSQL data in an empty directory (`emptyDir`) volume. If the empty directory size is limited, you can save the PostgreSQL data on a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to improve search performance. You can select a storageclass from your {acm-short} hub cluster to back up your search data. For example, if you select the `gp2` storageclass your configuration might resemble the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: search.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: Search
metadata:
  name: search-v2-operator
  namespace: open-cluster-management
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: ""
spec:
  dbStorage:
    size: 10Gi
    storageClassName: gp2
----
+
This configuration creates a PVC named `gp2-search` and is mounted to the `search-postgres` pod. By default, the storage size is `10Gi`. You can modify the storage size. For example, `20Gi` might be sufficient for about 200 managed clusters.

+
- Optimize cost by tuning the pod memory or CPU requirements, replica count, and update log levels for any of the four search pods (`indexer`, `database`, `queryapi`, or `collector` pod). Update the `deployment` section of the `search-v2-operator` custom resource. There are four deployments managed by the `search-v2-operator`, which can be updated individually. Your `search-v2-operator` custom resource might resemble the following file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: search.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: Search
metadata:
  name: search-v2-operator
  namespace: open-cluster-management
spec:
  deployments:
    collector:
      resources: <1>
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 128Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 250m
          memory: 64Mi
    indexer:
      replicaCount: 3
    database: <2>
        envVar:
          - name: POSTGRESQL_EFFECTIVE_CACHE_SIZE
            value: 1024MB
          - name: POSTGRESQL_SHARED_BUFFERS
            value: 512MB
          - name: WORK_MEM
            value: 128MB
    queryapi:
      arguments: <3>
      - -v=3
----
+
<1> You can apply resources to an `indexer`, `database`, `queryapi`, or `collector` pod.
<2> You can add multiple environment variables in the `envVar` section to specify a value for each variable that you name. 
<3> You can control the log level verbosity for any of the previous four pods by adding the `- -v=3` argument.
+
See the following example where memory resources are applied to the indexer pod:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    indexer:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 5Gi
        requests:
          memory: 1Gi 
----

- Define the node placement for search pods.
+
You can update the `Placement` of search pods by using the `nodeSelector` parameter, or the `tolerations` parameter. View the following example configuration:

+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
 dbStorage:
  size: 10Gi
 deployments:
  collector: {}
  database: {}
  indexer: {}
  queryapi: {}
 nodeSelector:
  node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
 tolerations:
 - effect: NoSchedule
  key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
  operator: Exists
----

- Specify your search query by selecting the *Advanced search* drop-down button to filter the _Column_, _Operator_, and _Value_ options or add a search constraint.

[#search-operations]
== Search operations and data types

Specify your search query by using search operations as conditions. Characters such as `+>, >=, <, <=, !=+` are supported. See the following search operation table:

.Search operation table
|===
| Default operation | Data type | Description

| `=`
| string, number
| This is the default operation.

| `!` or `!=`
| string, number
| This represents the _NOT_ operation, which means to exclude from the search results.

| `<, <=, >, >=`
| number
| 

| `>`
| date
| Dates matching the last hour, day, week, month, and year.

| `*`
| string
| Partial string match.
