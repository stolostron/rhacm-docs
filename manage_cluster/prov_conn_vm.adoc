[#creating-a-provider-connection-for-vmware-vsphere]
= Creating a provider connection for VMware vSphere

You need a provider connection to use {product-title} console to deploy and manage a {ocp-short} cluster on VMware vSphere. Note: Only {ocp-short} versions 4.5.x, and later, are supported.

Note: This procedure must be done before you can create a cluster with {product-title-short}.

[#vsphere_prov_conn_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a provider connection:

* A deployed {product-title-short} hub cluster
* Internet access for your {product-title-short} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on VMware vSphere
* VMware vSphere login credentials and vCenter requirements configured for {ocp-short} when using installer-provisioned infrastructure.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned.html[Installing a cluster on vSphere]. These credentials include the following information:
** vCenter account privileges
** Cluster resources
** DHCP available
** ESXi hosts have time synchronized (for example, NTP)

[#vsphere_provider_conn]
== Creating a provider connection by using the console

To create a provider connection from the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. On the _Clusters_ page, select the _Provider connections_ tab.
+
Existing provider connections are displayed.

. Select *Add a connection*.
. Select *VMware vSphere* as your provider.
. Add a name for your provider connection.
. Select a namespace for your provider connection from the list.
+
Tip: Create a namespace specifically to host your provider connections, both for convenience and added security.

. You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your provider connection. If you add the base DNS domain to the provider connection, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this provider connection.
. Add your _VMware vCenter server fully-qualified host name or IP address_. The value must be defined in the vCenter server root CA certificate. If possible, use the fully-qualified host name.
. Add your _VMware vCenter username_.
. Add your _VMware vCenter password_.
. Add your _VMware vCenter root CA certificate_.
.. You can download your certificate in the `download.zip` package with the certificate from the https:// vCenter address /certs/download.zip[VMware vCenter].
.. Unpackage the `download.zip`.
.. Use the certificate from the `certs/<platform> directory that has a `.0` extension. *Tip:* You can use the `ls certs/<platform>` command to list all of the available certificates for your platform.
+
Replace _<platform>_ with the abbreviation for your platform: `lin`, `mac`, or `win`. 
+
For example: `certs/lin 3a343545.0`
. Add your _VMware vSphere cluster name_.
. Add your _VMware vSphere datacenter_.
. Add your _VMware vSphere default datastore_.

. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift Pull Secret_.
You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH Private Key_ and _SSH Public Key_, which allows you to connect to the cluster.
You can use an existing key pair, or create a new one with key generation program.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-default.html#ssh-agent-using_installing-aws-default[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent] for more information about how to generate a key.
. Click *Create*.
When you create the provider connection, it is added to the list of provider connections.

You can create a cluster that uses this provider connection by completing the steps in xref:../manage_cluster/create_vm.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-vmware-vsphere[Creating a cluster on VMware vSphere].

[#vsphere_delete_provider_conn]
== Deleting your provider connection

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a provider connection, delete the provider connection to protect the information in the provider connection.

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. Select *Provider connections*.
. Select the options menu beside the provider connection that you want to delete.
. Select *Delete connection*.
