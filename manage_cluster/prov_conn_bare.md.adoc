[#creating-a-provider-connection-for-bare-metal]
= Creating a provider connection for bare metal

You need a provider connection to use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console to deploy and manage a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster in a bare metal environment.

NOTE: The options for bare metal in the console are for technical preview only, and are hidden by feature flags by default.
See the instructions for enabling the feature flags in the _Prerequisites_ section.

[#bare_prov_conn_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You need the following prerequisites before creating a provider connection:

* A Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes hub cluster that is deployed.
When managing bare metal clusters, you must have the hub cluster installed on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.4, or later.
* Internet access for your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on your bare metal server
* Your bare metal server login credentials, which include the libvirt URI, SSH Private Key, and a list of SSH known hosts;
see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.3/html/installing_on_bare_metal/installing-on-bare-metal#ssh-agent-using_installing-bare-metal[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent]
* Account permissions that allow installing clusters on the bare metal infrastructure
* Bare metal feature flags that are enabled to view the bare metal options.
The bare metal options are hidden by feature flags by default.
Complete the following steps to enable the feature flags:
 .. Start the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform command line interface.
 .. Edit the `consoleui` deployment resource to modify the settings:
+
----
MY_CONSOLEUI=`oc -n open-cluster-management get deploy -o name | grep consoleui`
oc -n open-cluster-management edit $MY_CONSOLEUI
----

 .. Change the feature flag setting to _true_.
Your update should look like the following example:
+
----
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      containers:
      - env:                              # Search for env:
        - name: featureFlags_baremetal
          value: "true"
        ...
----

 .. Edit the `consoleui` deployment resource to modify the settings:
+
----
MY_HEADER=`oc -n open-cluster-management get deploy -o name | grep header`
oc -n open-cluster-management edit $MY_HEADER
----

 .. Change the feature flag setting to _true_.
Your update should look like the following example:
+
----
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      containers:
      - env:                              # Search for env:
        - name: featureFlags_baremetal
          value: "true"
        ...
----

 .. Watch to make sure the `+console-chart-...-consoleui...+` and `+console-header-...+` pods are running:
+
----
oc -n open-cluster-management get pods
----

 .. When the pods are running again, log out of the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console and log back in.

[#bare_provider_conn]
== Creating a provider connection by using the console

To create a provider connection from the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. On the _Clusters_ page, select the _Provider connections_ tab.
+
Existing provider connections are displayed.

. Select *Add connection*.
. Select *Bare metal* as your provider.
. Add a name for your provider connection.
. Select a namespace for your provider connection from the list.
+
TIP: Create a namespace specifically to host your provider connections, both for convenience and added security.

. Add your _libvirt URI_.
See https://libvirt.org/uri.html[Connection URIs] for more information.
. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift Pull Secret_.
You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH Private Key_ so you can access the cluster.
You can use an existing key, or use a key generation program to create a new one.
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.3/html/installing_on_bare_metal/installing-on-bare-metal#ssh-agent-using_installing-bare-metal[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent] for more information about how to generate a key.
. Add a list of your SSH known hosts.
. Click *Create*.
When you create the provider connection, it is added to the list of provider connections.

You can create a cluster that uses this provider connection by completing the steps in link:create_bare.md.adoc[Creating a cluster on bare metal].

[#bare_delete_provider_conn]
== Deleting your provider connection

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a provider connection, delete the provider connection to protect the information in the provider connection.

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. Select *Provider connections*.
. Select the options menu beside the provider connection that you want to delete.
. Select *Delete connection*.
