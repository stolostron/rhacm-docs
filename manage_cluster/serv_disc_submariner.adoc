[#enable-service-discovery-submariner]
= Enabling service discovery for Submariner

After Submariner is deployed into the same environment as your managed clusters, the routes are configured for secure IP routing between the Pod and services across the clusters in the `ManagedClusterSet`. To make a service from a cluster visible and discoverable to other clusters in the `ManagedClusterSet`, you must create a `ServiceExport` object. After a service is exported with a `ServiceExport` object, you can access the the service by the following format: `<service>.<namespace>.svc.clusterset.local`. If multiple clusters export a service with the same name, and from the same namespace, they are recognized by other clusters as a single logical service. 

This example uses the `nginx` service in the `default` namespace, but you can discover any Kubernetes `ClusterIP` service or headless service. 

. Apply an instance of the `nginx` service on a managed cluster that is in the `ManagedClusterSet` by entering the following commands:
+
----
oc -n default create deployment nginx --image=nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:stable-alpine
oc -n default expose deployment nginx --port=8080
----

. Export the service by creating a `ServiceExport` entry that resembles the following content in the yaml file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lighthouse.submariner.io/v2alpha1
kind: ServiceExport
metadata:
  name: <service-name>
  namespace: <service-namespace>
----
Replace _service-name_ with the name of the service that you are exporting. In this example, it is `nginx`. 
Replace _service-namespace_ with the name of the namespace where the service is located. In this example, it is `default`.

. Run the following command from a different managed cluster to confirm that it can access the `nginx` service:
+
----
oc -n default run --generator=run-pod/v1 tmp-shell --rm -i --tty --image quay.io/submariner/nettest -- /bin/bash curl nginx.default.svc.clusterset.local:8080
----
