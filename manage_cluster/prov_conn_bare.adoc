[#creating-a-provider-connection-for-bare-metal]
= Creating a provider connection for bare metal

**Important:** The bare metal cluster function is a technology preview,and should not be used in production environments.

You need a provider connection to use {product-title} console to deploy and manage a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster in a bare metal environment.

NOTE: The options for bare metal in the console are for technology preview only, and are hidden by feature flags by default.
See the instructions for enabling the feature flags in the _Prerequisites_ section.

[#bare_prov_conn_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You need the following prerequisites before creating a provider connection:

* A {product-title} hub cluster that is deployed.
When managing bare metal clusters, you must have the hub cluster installed on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.5, or later.
* Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on your bare metal server
* Your bare metal server login credentials, which include the libvirt URI, SSH Private Key, and a list of SSH known hosts;
see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.3/html/installing_on_bare_metal/installing-on-bare-metal#ssh-agent-using_installing-bare-metal[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent]
* Account permissions that allow installing clusters on the bare metal infrastructure
* Bare metal feature flags that are enabled to view the bare metal options.
The bare metal options are hidden by feature flags by default.
Complete the following steps to enable the feature flags:
 .. Start the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform command line interface.
 .. Set the `featureFlags_baremetal` setting to *true* for the `console-header` container by entering the following command:
+
----
oc patch deploy console-header -n <namespace> -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"console-header","env": [{"name": "featureFlags_baremetal","value":"true"}]}]}}}}'
----
Replace <namespace> with your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management project namespace.
+
After the update, your `consoleui` CRD should look like the following example:
+
----
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      containers:
      - env:                              # Search for env:
        - name: featureFlags_baremetal
          value: "true"
        ...
----

 .. Set the `featureFlags_baremetal` value to *true* for the `hmc-ui` container:
+
----
oc patch -n <namespace> $(oc get deploy -o name | grep consoleui) -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"hcm-ui","env": [{"name": "featureFlags_baremetal","value":"true"}]}]}}}}'
----
Replace <namespace> with your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management project namespace.
+
Your update should look like the following example:
+
----
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      containers:
      - env:                              # Search for env:
        - name: featureFlags_baremetal
          value: "true"
        ...
----

 .. Make sure the `+console-chart-...-consoleui...+` and `+console-header-...+` pods are running:
+
----
oc -n open-cluster-management get pods
----

 .. When the pods are running again, log out of the {product-title} console and log back in. The bare metal options are now included in the console.

[#bare_provider_conn]
== Creating a provider connection by using the console

To create a provider connection from the {product-title} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. On the _Clusters_ page, select the _Provider connections_ tab.
+
Existing provider connections are displayed.

. Select *Add connection*.
. Select *Bare metal* as your provider.
. Add a name for your provider connection.
. Select a namespace for your provider connection from the list.
+
Tip: Create a namespace specifically to host your provider connections, both for convenience and added security.

. You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your provider connection. If you add the base DNS domain to the provider connection, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this provider connection.
. Add your _libvirt URI_.
See https://libvirt.org/uri.html[Connection URIs] for more information.
. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift Pull Secret_.
You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH Private Key_ and your _SSH Public Key_ so you can access the cluster.
You can use an existing key, or use a key generation program to create a new one.
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.3/html/installing_on_bare_metal/installing-on-bare-metal#ssh-agent-using_installing-bare-metal[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent] for more information about how to generate a key.
. Add a list of your SSH known hosts.
. For disconnected installations only: Complete the fields in the *Configuration for disconnected installation* subsection with the required information:
+
* _Image Registry Mirror_: This optional value contains the disconnected registry path. The path contains the hostname, port, and repository path to all of the installation images for disconnected installations. An example value is : `repository.com:5000/openshift/ocp-release`.
* _Bootstrap OS Image_: This value contains the URL to the image to use for the bootstrap machine.
* _Cluster OS Image_: This value contains the URL to the image to use for {ocp} cluster machines. 
* _Additional Trust Bundle_: This value provides the contents of the certificate file that is required to access the mirror registry.

. Click *Create*.
When you create the provider connection, it is added to the list of provider connections.

You can create a cluster that uses this provider connection by completing the steps in xref:../manage_cluster/create_bare.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-bare-metal[Creating a cluster on bare metal].

[#bare_delete_provider_conn]
== Deleting your provider connection

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a provider connection, delete the provider connection to protect the information in the provider connection.

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. Select *Provider connections*.
. Select the options menu beside the provider connection that you want to delete.
. Select *Delete connection*.
