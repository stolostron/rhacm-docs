[#iam-policy-controller]
= IAM policy controller

The Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy controller can be used to receive notifications about IAM policies that are non-compliant.
The compliance check is based on the parameters that you configure in the IAM policy.

The IAM policy controller monitors for the desired maximum number of users with a particular cluster role (i.e. `ClusterRole`) in your cluster. The default cluster role to monitor is `cluster-admin`. The IAM policy controller communicates with the local Kubernetes API server. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[Extend the Kubernetes API with CustomResourceDefinitions].

The IAM policy controller runs on your managed cluster. View the following sections to learn more:
