[#iam-policy-controller]
= IAM policy controller (Deprecated)

The Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy controller can be used to receive notifications about IAM policies that are non-compliant. The compliance check is based on the parameters that you configure in the IAM policy. The IAM policy is provided in the `policy-templates` field of the policy on the hub cluster and is propagated to the selected managed clusters by the governance framework. See the xref:../governance/policy_overview.adoc#policy-yaml-structure[Policy YAML structure] documentation for more details on the hub cluster policy.

The IAM policy controller monitors for the desired maximum number of users with a particular cluster role (i.e. `ClusterRole`) in your cluster. The default cluster role to monitor is `cluster-admin`. The IAM policy controller communicates with the local Kubernetes API server.

The IAM policy controller runs on your managed cluster. View the following sections to learn more:

View the following example of an IAM policy and review the parameters in the YAML table:

[#iam-policy-yaml-table]
== IAM policy YAML table

View the following parameter table for descriptions:

.Parameter table
|===
| Field | Optional or required | Description

| `apiVersion`
| Required
| Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| `kind`
| Required
| Set the value to `Policy` to indicate the type of policy.

| `metadata.name`
| Required
| The name for identifying the policy resource.

| `spec.clusterRole`
| Optional
| The cluster role (i.e. `ClusterRole`) to monitor. This defaults to `cluster-admin` if not specified.

| `spec.severity`
| Optional
| Informs the user of the severity when the policy is non-compliant. Use the following parameter values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`.

| `spec.remediationAction`
| Optional
| Specifies the remediation of your policy.
Enter `inform`. The IAM policy controller only supports the `inform` feature.

| `spec.ignoreClusterRoleBindings`
| Optional
| A list of regular expression (regex) values that indicate which cluster role binding names to ignore. These regular expression values must follow link:https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax[Go regexp syntax]. By default, all cluster role bindings that have a name that starts with `system:` are ignored. It is recommended to set this to a stricter value. To not ignore any cluster role binding names, set the list to a single value of `.^` or some other regular expression that never matches.

| `spec.maxClusterRoleBindingUsers`
| Required
| Maximum number of IAM role bindings that are available before a policy is considered non-compliant.
