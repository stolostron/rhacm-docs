[#iam-policy-controller]
= IAM policy controller

Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy controller can be used to receive notifications about IAM policies that are non-compliant.
The compliance check is based on the parameters that you configure in the IAM policy.

The IAM policy controller checks for compliance of the number of cluster administrators that you allow in your cluster. IAM policy controller communicates with the local Kubernetes API server. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[Extend the Kubernetes API with CustomResourceDefinitions].

The IAM policy controller runs on your managed cluster. View the following sections to learn more:

kind: IamPolicy 
metadata:
  name:
spec:
  severity:
  namespaceSelector:
    include:
    exclude:
  remediationAction: 
  maxClusterRoleBindingUsers:

[#iam-policy-yaml-table]
== IAM policy YAMl table

View the following parameter table for descriptions:
