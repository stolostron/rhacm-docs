[#iam-policy-controller]
= IAM policy controller

Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy controller can be used to receive notifications about IAM policies that are non-compliant.
The compliance check is based on the parameters that you configure in the IAM policy.

The IAM policy controller checks for compliance of the number of cluster administrators that you allow in your cluster. IAM policy controller communicates with the local Kubernetes API server. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[Extend the Kubernetes API with CustomResourceDefinitions].

The IAM policy controller runs on your managed cluster. View the following sections to learn more:

[#iam-policy-yaml-structure]
== IAM policy YAML structure

View the following example of an IAM policy and review the parameters in the YAML table:

[source,yaml]

kind: IamPolicy 
metadata:
  name:
spec:
  severity:
  namespaceSelector:
    include:
    exclude:
  remediationAction: 
  maxClusterRoleBindingUsers:
  ignoreClusterRoleBindings:

[#iam-policy-yaml-table]
== IAM policy YAMl table

View the following parameter table for descriptions:

.Parameter table
|===
| Field | Description

| apiVersion
| Required.
Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| kind
| Required.
Set the value to `Policy` to indicate the type of policy.

| metadata.name
| Required.
The name for identifying the policy resource.

| spec
| Required.
Add configuration details for your policy.

| spec.severity
| Optional.
Informs the user of the severity when the policy is non-compliant. Use the following parameter values: `low`, `medium`, or `high`.

| spec.namespaceSelector
| Required.
The namespaces within the hub cluster that the policy is applied to.
Enter at least one namespace for the `include` parameter, which are the namespaces you want to apply to the policy to.
The `exclude` parameter specifies the namespaces you explicitly do not want to apply the policy to.
*Note*: A namespace that is specified in the object template of a policy controller overrides the namespace in the preceding parameter values.

| spec.remediationAction
| Optional.
Specifies the remediation of your policy.
Enter  `inform`.

| spec.ignoreClusterRoleBindings
| Optional.
A list of regular expression (regex) values signifying which cluster role binding names to ignore.
These regular expression values must follow https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax[Go regexp syntax].
By default, all cluster role bindings that have a name which starts with `system:`` will be ignored.
It is recommended to set this to a stricter value. To not ignore any cluster role binding names, set
the list to a single value of `.^` or some other regular expression that will never match.

| spec.maxClusterRoleBindingUsers
| Required.
Maximum number of IAM role bindings that are available before a policy is considered non-compliant.
