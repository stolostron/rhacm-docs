Use the _Governance_ dashboard to create, view, and manage your security policies and policy violations. You can create YAML files for your policies from the CLI and console. 

[#grc-view]
== Governance page

The following tabs are displayed on the _Governance_ page:

* **Overview**
+
View the following summary cards from the _Overview_ tab: _Policy set violations_, _Policy violations_, _Clusters_, _Categories_, _Controls_, and _Standards_.

* **Policy sets**
+
Create and manage hub cluster policy sets.

* **Policies**
+
Create and manage security policies. The table of policies lists the following details of a policy: _Name_, _Namespace_, _Status_, _Remediation_, _Policy set_, _Cluster violations_, _Source_, _Automation_ and _Created_. 
+
You can edit, enable or disable, set remediation to inform or enforce, or remove a policy by selecting the *Actions* icon. You can view the categories and standards of a specific policy by selecting the drop-down arrow to expand the row.
+
Complete bulk actions by selecting multiple policies and clicking the *Actions* button. You can also customize your policy table by clicking the *Filter* button.

If there is a configured automation for a specific policy, you can select the automation to view more details. View the following descriptions of the schedule frequency options for your automation:

- _Manual run_ mode: Manually set this automation to run once. After the automation runs, it is set to `disabled`. Select the _Manual run_ checkbox for the automation.
- _Once mode_: When a policy is violated, the automation runs one time. After the automation runs, it is set to `disabled`. After the automation is set to `disabled`, you must continue to run the automation manually. When you run _once mode_, the extra variable of `target_clusters` is automatically supplied with the list of clusters that violated the policy. The Ansible Tower Job Template must have `PROMPT ON LAUNCH` enabled for the `EXTRA VARIABLES` section.
- _Disabled_: When the scheduled automation is set to `disabled`, the automation does not run until the setting is updated.

When you select a policy in the table list, the following tabs of information are displayed from the console:

- _Details_: Select the _Details_ tab to view policy details and placement details. In the _Placement_ table, the _Compliance_ column provides links to view the compliance of the clusters that are displayed.
- _Results_: Select the _Results_ tab to view a table list of all clusters that are associated to the policy. 
+
From the _Message_ column, click the **View details** link to view the template details, template YAML, and related resources. You can also view related resources. Click the **View history** link to view the violation message and a time of the last report.
