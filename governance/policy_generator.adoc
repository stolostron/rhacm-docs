[#policy-generator]
= Policy generator

The policy generator builds {product-title} policies from Kubernetes YAML file, which are provided through a `PolicyGenerator` custom resource (CR). The policy generator is a binary that is compiled for use as a Kustomize plugin. For more information, see link:https://kustomize.io/[Kustomize].

[#policy-generator-components]
== Policy generator components

The policy generator requires a Kustomize plugin, a `Placement` resource, and policy expanders. View the following descriptions of the policy generator components:

* *Kustomize plugin*: The policy generator plugin is a binary written in Go language. The binary accepts an input manifest of the `PolicyGenerator` kind in the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1` API. When Kustomize finds a `PolicyGenerator` resources in the `generators:` section of the `kustomization.yaml`, it looks in its directories for a binary of the same name (`PolicyGenerator`) in the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/vi/policygenerator` directory. Kustomize also calls the binary as `<path>/PolicyGenerator <cached-manifest>` to run the generator as its plugin. The `--enable-alpha-plugins` flag  must be specified in the Kustomize command for the external generator plugin to be enabled.

* *Placement*: By default, a `Placement` and `PlacementBinding` are created for each policy with the policy. If you want to consolidate policies that use the same `Placement` in a single `PlacementBinding`, either specify `placement.placementRulePath` to an existing `Placement` manifest or set `placement.name` along with `placement.clusterSelectors`. When the `PlacementBinding` is consolidated in this way, `placementBindingDefaults.name` must be specified so that the generator can create unique names for the bindings.

* *Policy expanders*: Policy expanders provide logic to create additional policies based on a given kind to the violations or status using {product-title-short} policies. Generally, the expanders point to kinds provided by third-party policy engines such as Kyverno and Gatekeeper. These expanders are enabled by default, but can be disabled individually by setting the flag associated with the expander in the `PolicyGenerator` manifest either in policyDefaults or for a particular manifest in the policies array.
//in the doc, we refer to Gatekeeper as a third-party integration? Wonder of we should link Policy generator doc from the Integrate third-party doc
