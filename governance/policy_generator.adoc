[#policy-generator]
= Policy generator

The policy generator is a part of the {product-title} application lifecycle subscription GitOps workflow that generates {product-title} policies using Kustomize. The policy generator builds {product-title} policies from Kubernetes manifest YAML files, which are provided through a `PolicyGenerator` manifest YAML file that is used to configure it. The policy generator is implemented as a Kustomize generator plugin. For more information on Kustomize, see the link:https://kustomize.io/[Kustomize documentation]. 

[#policy-generator-capabilities]
== Policy generator capabilities

The policy generator and its integration with the {product-title-short} application lifecycle link:../applications/subscription_sample.adoc#applying-kustomize[subscription] GitOps workflow simplifies the distribution of Kubernetes resource objects to managed OpenShift clusters, and Kubernetes clusters through {product-title-short} policies. In particular, use the policy generator to complete the following actions:

- Convert any Kubernetes manifest files to {product-title-short} link:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#kubernetes-configuration-policy-controller[configuration policies].
- Patch the input Kubernetes manifests before they are inserted into a generated {product-title-short} policy.
- Generate additional configuration policies to be able to report on link:https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/[Gatekeeper] and link:https://kyverno.io/[Kyverno] policy violations through {product-title}.
- Generate policy sets on the hub cluster. See xref:../governance/policy_set_ctrl.adoc#policy-set-controller[Policy set controller] for more details.

[#policy-generator-configuration]
== Policy generator configuration structure

The policy generator is a Kustomize generator plugin that is configured with a manifest of the `PolicyGenerator` kind and `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1` API version. 

To use the plugin, start by adding a `generators` section in a link:https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/[`kustomization.yaml`] file. View the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
generators:
  - policy-generator-config.yaml
----

The `policy-generator-config.yaml` file referenced in the previous example is a YAML file with the instructions of the policies to generate. A simple policy generator configuration file might resemble the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PolicyGenerator
metadata:
  name: config-data-policies
policyDefaults:
  namespace: policies
  policySets: []
policies:
  - name: config-data
    manifests:
      - path: configmap.yaml
----

The `configmap.yaml` represents a Kubernetes manifest YAML file to be included in the policy. View the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
  namespace: default
data:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
----

The generated `Policy`, along with the generated `PlacementRule` and `PlacementBinding` might resemble the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementRule
metadata:
  name: placement-config-data

[#policy-gen-install-operator]
== Generating a policy to install an Operator

A common use of {product-title-short} policies is to link:hhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-installing-operator-from-operatorhub-using-cli_olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[install an Operator] on one or more managed OpenShift clusters. View the following examples of the different installation modes and the required resources. 

[#policy-install-ocp-gitops]
=== A policy to install OpenShift GitOps

This example shows how to generate a policy that installs OpenShift GitOps using the policy generator. The OpenShift GitOps operator offers the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-installing-operators-from-operatorhub_olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[_all namespaces_ installation mode]. First, a `Subscription` manifest file called `openshift-gitops-subscription.yaml` needs to be created like the following example.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----

To pin to a specific version of the operator, you can set the `spec.startingCSV` value to `openshift-gitops-operator.v1.2.1` (replace `v1.2.1` with your preferred version).

Next, a policy generator configuration file called `policy-generator-config.yaml` is required. The following example shows a single policy that installs OpenShift GitOps on all OpenShift managed clusters:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PolicyGenerator
metadata:
  name: install-openshift-gitops
policyDefaults:
  namespace: policies
  placement:
    clusterSelectors:
      vendor: "OpenShift"
  remediationAction: enforce
policies:
  - name: install-openshift-gitops
    manifests:
      - path: openshift-gitops-subscription.yaml
----

The last file that is required is the `kustomization.yaml` file. The `kustomization.yaml` file requires the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
generators:

[#policy-gen-install-compliance-operator]
=== A policy to install the Compliance Operator

For an operator that uses the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-installing-operators-from-operatorhub_olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[_namespaced_ installation mode], such as the Compliance Operator, an `OperatorGroup` manifest is also required. This example shows a generated policy to install the Compliance Operator.

First, a YAML file with a `Namespace`, a `Subscription`, and an `OperatorGroup` manifest called `compliance-operator.yaml` must be created. The following example installs these manifests in the `compliance-operator` namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-compliance
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1

  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
    - compliance-operator
----

Next, a policy generator configuration file called `policy-generator-config.yaml` is required. The following example shows a single policy that installs the Compliance Operator on all OpenShift managed clusters:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PolicyGenerator

  remediationAction: enforce
policies:
  - name: install-compliance-operator
    manifests:

----

The last file that is required is the `kustomization.yaml` file. The following configuration is required in the `kustomization.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
generators:

//[#policy-gen-policy-sets]
//=== A policy to create policy sets

[#policy-gen-install-on-openshift-gitops]
== Install the policy generator on OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)

OpenShift GitOps, based on link:https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/[ArgoCD], can also be used to generate policies using the policy generator through GitOps. Since the policy generator does not come preinstalled in the OpenShift GitOps container image, some customization must take place. In order to follow along, it is expected that you have the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cicd/gitops/installing-openshift-gitops.html[OpenShift GitOps Operator] installed on the {product-title-short} hub cluster and be sure to log into the hub cluster.

In order for OpenShift GitOps to have access to the policy generator when you run Kustomize, an Init Container is required to copy the policy generator binary from the {product-title-short} Application Subscription container image to the OpenShift GitOps container, that runs Kustomize. For more details, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/nodes/containers/nodes-containers-init.html[Using Init Containers to perform tasks before a pod is deployed]. Additionally, OpenShift GitOps must be configured to provide the `--enable-alpha-plugins` flag when you run Kustomize. Start editing the OpenShift GitOps `argocd` object with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
oc -n openshift-gitops edit argocd openshift-gitops
----


Then modify the OpenShift GitOps `argocd` object to contain the following additional YAML content. When a new major version of {product-title-short} is released and you want to update the policy generator to a newer version, you need to update the `registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel8` image used by the Init Container to a newer tag. View the following example and replace `<version>` with {product-version} or your desired {product-title-short} version:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  kustomizeBuildOptions: --enable-alpha-plugins
  repo:
    env:
    - name: KUSTOMIZE_PLUGIN_HOME
      value: /etc/kustomize/plugin
    initContainers:
    - args:
      - -c
      - cp /etc/kustomize/plugin/policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1/policygenerator/PolicyGenerator
        /policy-generator/PolicyGenerator
      command:
      - /bin/bash
      image: registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel8:v<version>
      name: policy-generator-install
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /policy-generator
        name: policy-generator
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /etc/kustomize/plugin/policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1/policygenerator
      name: policy-generator
    volumes:
    - emptyDir: {}
      name: policy-generator
----

Now that OpenShift GitOps can use the policy generator, OpenShift GitOps must be granted access to create policies on the {product-title-short} hub cluster. Create the following `ClusterRole` resource called `openshift-gitops-policy-admin`, with access to create, read, update, and delete policies and placements. Your `ClusterRole` might resemble the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
rules:
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - policy.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - policies
      - placementbindings
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - apps.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - placementrules
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - cluster.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - placements
      - placements/status
      - placementdecisions
      - placementdecisions/status
----

Additionally, create a `ClusterRoleBinding` object to grant the OpenShift GitOps service account access to the `openshift-gitops-policy-admin` `ClusterRole`. Your `ClusterRoleBinding` might resemble the following resource:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
subjects:

Note that all the fields in the `policyDefaults` section except for `namespace` can be overridden per policy.

|===
| Field | Description

| apiVersion
| Required

Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| complianceType
| Optional

Determines the policy controller behavior when comparing the manifest to objects on the cluster. The parameter values are `musthave`, `mustonlyhave`, or `mustnothave`. The default value is `musthave`.

| Required

Set the value to `PolicyGenerator` to indicate the type of policy.

| metadata
| Required

Used to uniquely identify the configuration file.

| metadata.name
| Required

The name for identifying the policy resource.

| placementBindingDefaults
| Required

Used to consolidate multiple policies in a `PlacementBinding`, so that the generator can create unique `PlacementBinding` names using the name that is defined.
//what is the default value ? 
| placementBindingDefaults.name
| Optional.

It is best practice to set an explicit placement binding name to use rather than use the default value.

| policyDefaults
| Required

Any default value listed here is overridden for an entry in the policies array except for `namespace`.

| policyDefaults.categories
| Optional

Array of categories to be used in the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/categories` annotation. The default value is `CM Configuration Management`.

| policyDefaults.configurationPolicyAnnotations
| Optional

Key-value pairs of annotations to set on generated configuration policies. For example, you can disable policy templates by defining the following parameter: `{"policy.open-cluster-management.io/disable-templates": "true"}`. The default value is empty (`{}`).

| policyDefaults.controls
| Optional

Array of controls to be used in the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/controls` annotation. The default value is `CM-2 Baseline Configuration`.

| policyDefaults.consolidateManifests
| Optional

This determines if a single configuration policy should be generated for all the manifests being wrapped in the policy. If set to `false`, a configuration policy per manifest is generated. The default value is `true`.

| policyDefaults.informGatekeeperPolicies
| Optional

When the policy references a violated gatekeeper policy manifest, this determines if an additional configuration policy should be generated in order to receive policy violations in {product-title-short}. The default value is `true`.

| policyDefaults.informKyvernoPolicies
| Optional

When the policy references a Kyverno policy manifest, this determines if an additional configuration policy should be generated to receive policy violations in {product-title-short}, when the Kyverno policy has been violated. The default value is `true`.

| policyDefaults.namespace
| Required

The namespace of all the policies.

| policyDefaults.placement
| Optional

The placement configuration for the policies. This defaults to a placement configuration that matches all clusters.

| placement.clusterSelectors
| Optional

Specify a placement by defining a cluster selector in the following format, `key:value`. See `placementRulePath` to specify an existing file.

| placement.name
| Optional

Specify a name to consolidate placement rules that contain the same cluster selectors.

| placement.placementRulePath
| Optional

To reuse an existing placement rule, specify the path here relative to the `kustomization.yaml` file. If provided, this placement rule is used by all policies by default. See `clusterSelectors` to generate a new `Placement`.

| policyDefaults.remediationAction
| Optional

The remediation mechanism of your policy. The parameter values are `enforce` and `inform`. The default value is `inform`.

| policyDefaults.severity
| Optional

The severity of the policy violation. The default value is `low`.

| policyDefaults.standards
| Optional

An array of standards to be used in the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/standards` annotation. The default value is `NIST SP 800-53`.

The list of Kubernetes object manifests to include in the policy.

| policies[ ].name
| Required

The name of the policy to create.

| policies[ ].manifests[ ].complianceType
| Optional

Determines the policy controller behavior when comparing the manifest to objects on the cluster. The parameter values are `musthave`, `mustonlyhave`, or `mustnothave`. The default value is `musthave`.

| policies[ ].manifests[ ].path
| Required

Path to a single file or a flat directory of files relative to the `kustomization.yaml` file.

| policies[ ].manifests[ ].patches
| Optional

A Kustomize patch to apply to the manifest at the path. If there are multiple manifests, the patch requires the `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name`, and `metadata.namespace` (if applicable) fields to be set so Kustomize can identify the manifest that the patch applies to. If there is a single manifest, the `metadata.name` and `metadata.namespace` fields can be patched.
