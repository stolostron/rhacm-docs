[#creating-an-ocp-cis-policy-from-the-console]
== Creating an OpenShift CIS scan policy from the console

As you create an {ocp-short} CIS policy from the console, a YAML file is also created in the YAML editor. 
*Note:* The compliance operator must be installed. For more details, see xref:../governance/create_compliance_operator.adoc#creating-a-compliance-operator-policy-from-the-console[Creating a compliance operator policy from the console]. 

Complete the following steps to create an {ocp-short} CIS policy from the console:

. Log in to your hub cluster.

. From the navigation menu, select *Governance*. 

. Click *Create policy*. Select _Custom specification_ from the _Specification_ field. Copy and paste the https://github.com/open-cluster-management/policy-collection/blob/main/stable/CM-Configuration-Management/policy-compliance-operator-cis-scan.yaml[`policy-compliance-operator-cis-scan`] file contents from the `policy-collection` repository.
+ 
The following resources are created: `ScanSettingBinding` (`compliance-cis-scan`), a `ComplianceSuite` (`compliance-suite-cis`), and a `ComplianceCheckResult` (`compliance-suite-cis-results`).
+
*Note:* Automatic remediation is supported. Set the remediation action to `enforce` to create `ScanSettingBinding` resource. 

An OpenShift CIS scan policy is created.
