[#memory-usage-policy]
= Memory usage policy

Kubernetes configuration policy controller monitors the status of the memory usage policy.
Use the memory usage policy to limit or restrict your memory and compute usage.
For more information, see _Limit Ranges_ in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/[Kubernetes documentation].

Learn more details about the memory usage policy structure in the following sections:

[#memory-usage-policy-yaml-structure]
== Memory usage policy YAML structure

Your memory usage policy might resemble the following YAML file:

[source,yaml]

[#memory-usage-policy-table]
== Memory usage policy table

|===
| Field | Description

| apiVersion
| Required.
Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| kind
| Required.
Set the value to `Policy` to indicate the type of policy.

| metadata.name
| Required.
The name for identifying the policy resource.

| metadata.namespaces

Enter parameter values for `include`, which are the namespaces you want to apply to the policy to.
The `exclude` parameter specifies the namespaces you explicitly do not want to apply the policy to.
*Note*: A namespace that is specified in the object template of a policy controller overrides the namespace in the corresponding parent policy.
