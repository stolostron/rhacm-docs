[#policy-set-controller]
= Policy set controller

The policy set controller aggregates the policy status scoped to policies that are defined in the same namespace. Create a policy set (`PolicySet`) to group policies that in the same namespace. All policies in the `PolicySet` are placed together in a selected cluster by creating a `PlacementBinding` to bind the `PolicySet` and `Placement`. The policy set is deployed to the hub cluster.

Additionally, when a policy is a part of multiple policy sets, existing and new `Placement` resources remain in the policy. When a user removes a policy from the policy set, the policy is not applied to the cluster that is selected in the policy set, but the placements remain. The policy set controller only checks for violations in clusters that include the policy set placement.

*Note:* The {product-title-short} hardening sample policy set uses cluster placement. If you use cluster placement, bind the namespace containing the policy to the managed cluster set. See xref:../governance/deploy_gitops.adoc#deploying-policies-to-your-cluster[Deploying policies to your cluster] for more details on using cluster placement.
