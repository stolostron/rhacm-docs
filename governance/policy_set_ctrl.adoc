[#policy-set-controller]
= Policy set controller

The policy set controller aggregates the policy status scoped to policies that are defined in the same namespace. Create a policy set (`PolicySet`) to group policies that in the same namespace. All policies in the `PolicySet` are placed together in a selected cluster by creating a `PlacementBinding` to bind the `PolicySet` and `Placement`. The policy set is deployed to the hub cluster. 

Learn more details about the policy set structure in the following sections:

* <<policy-set-sample,Policy set CR sample>>

Your policy set might resemble the following YAML file:
