= Kyverno add network policy

The Kyverno add network policy configures a new `NetworkPolicy` resource called `default-deny` which denies all traffic when you create a new namespace. You must install Kyverno controller to use the Kyverno policy.

      By default, Kubernetes allows communications across all Pods within a cluster.
      The NetworkPolicy resource and a CNI plug-in that supports NetworkPolicy must be used to restrict
      communications. A default NetworkPolicy should be configured for each Namespace to
      default deny all ingress and egress traffic to the Pods in the Namespace. Application
      teams can then configure additional NetworkPolicy resources to allow desired traffic
      to application Pods from select sources. This policy will create a new NetworkPolicy resource
      named `default-deny` which will deny all traffic anytime a new Namespace is created.
