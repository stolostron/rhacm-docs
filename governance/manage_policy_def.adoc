= Managing policy definitions with OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)

OpenShift GitOps, based on ArgoCD, can also be used to manage policy definitions. To allow this workflow, OpenShift GitOps must be granted access to create policies on the {product-title-short} hub cluster. Create the following `ClusterRole` resource called `openshift-gitops-policy-admin`, with access to create, read, update, and delete policies and placements. Your `ClusterRole` might resemble the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
rules:
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - policy.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - policies
      - placementbindings
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - apps.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - placementrules
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - cluster.open-cluster-management.io
    resources:
      - placements
      - placements/status
      - placementdecisions
      - placementdecisions/status
----

Create a `ClusterRoleBinding` object to grant the OpenShift GitOps service account access to the `openshift-gitops-policy-admin` `ClusterRole` object. Your `ClusterRoleBinding` might resemble the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller
    namespace: openshift-gitops
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
----

When a {product-title-short} policy definition is deployed with OpenShift GitOps, a copy of the policy is created in each managed cluster namespace. These copies are called replicated policies. To prevent OpenShift GitOps from repeatedly deleting this replicated policy or show that the ArgoCD `Application` is out of sync, the `argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options: IgnoreExtraneous` annotation is automatically set on each replicated policy by the {product-title-short} policy framework.

ArgoCD labels and annotates objects in order to track them. For replicated policies to not show up at all in ArgoCD, you can set `spec.copyPolicyMetadata` to `false` on the {product-title-short} policy definition to prevent these ArgoCD tracking labels and annotations from being copied to the replicated policy.

== Integrating the Policy Generator with OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)

OpenShift GitOps, based on link:https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/[ArgoCD], can also be used to generate policies by using the Policy Generator through GitOps. Since the Policy Generator does not come preinstalled in the OpenShift GitOps container image, some customization must take place. In order to follow along, you must have the OpenShift GitOps Operator installed on the {product-title-short} hub cluster and be sure to log into the hub cluster.

In order for OpenShift GitOps to have access to the Policy Generator when you run Kustomize, an Init Container is required to copy the Policy Generator binary from the {product-title-short} Application Subscription container image to the OpenShift GitOps container. Additionally, OpenShift GitOps must be configured to provide the `--enable-alpha-plugins` flag when it runs Kustomize. Start editing the OpenShift GitOps `argocd` object with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
oc -n openshift-gitops edit argocd openshift-gitops
----

Then modify the OpenShift GitOps `argocd` object to contain the following additional YAML content. When a new major version of {product-title-short} is released and you want to update the Policy Generator to a newer version, you need to update the `registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel8` image used by the Init Container to a newer tag. View the following example and replace `<version>` with {product-version} or your desired {product-title-short} version:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  kustomizeBuildOptions: --enable-alpha-plugins
  repo:
    env:
    - name: KUSTOMIZE_PLUGIN_HOME
      value: /etc/kustomize/plugin
    initContainers:
    - args:
      - -c
      - cp /etc/kustomize/plugin/policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1/policygenerator/PolicyGenerator
        /policy-generator/PolicyGenerator
      command:
      - /bin/bash
      image: registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel8:v<version>
      name: policy-generator-install
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /policy-generator
        name: policy-generator
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /etc/kustomize/plugin/policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1/policygenerator
      name: policy-generator
    volumes:
    - emptyDir: {}
      name: policy-generator
----

Now that OpenShift GitOps can use the Policy Generator, OpenShift GitOps must be granted access to create policies on the {product-title-short} hub cluster. Create the `ClusterRole` resource called `openshift-gitops-policy-admin`, with access to create, read, update, and delete policies and placements. Refer to the ealier `ClusterRole` example.

Additionally, create a `ClusterRoleBinding` object to grant the OpenShift GitOps service account access to the `openshift-gitops-policy-admin` `ClusterRole`. Your `ClusterRoleBinding` might resemble the following resource:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller
    namespace: openshift-gitops
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: openshift-gitops-policy-admin
