= Configuring {aap-short} for governance

{product-title} governance can be integrated with {aap} to create policy violation automations. You can configure the automation from the {product-title-short} console.

[#prerequisites-grc-ansible]
== Prerequisites

* {ocp} 4.12 or later

* You must have {aap-short} version 3.7.3 or a later version installed. It is best practice to install the latest supported version of {aap-short}. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/[Red Hat {aap-short} documentation] for more details.

* Install the {aap-short}  Resource Operator from the Operator Lifecycle Manager. In the _Update Channel_ section, select `stable-2.x-cluster-scoped`. Select the *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* installation mode.
+
*Note:* Ensure that the {aap-short} job template is idempotent when you run it. If you do not have {aap-short} Resource Operator, you can find it from the {ocp} _OperatorHub_ page. 

For more information about installing and configuring {aap}, see link:../applications/ansible_config.adoc#setting-up-ansible[Setting up Ansible tasks].

[#creating-a-policy-violation-auto-console]
== Creating a policy violation automation from the console

After you log in to your {product-title-short} hub cluster, select *Governance* from the navigation menu, and then click on the _Policies_ tab to view the policy tables. 

Configure an automation for a specific policy by clicking *Configure* in the _Automation_ column. You can create automation when the policy automation panel appears. From the _Ansible credential_ section, click the drop-down menu to select an Ansible credential. If you need to add a credential, see link:../clusters/credentials/credential_intro.adoc#managing-credentials-overview[Managing credentials overview].

*Note:* This credential is copied to the same namespace as the policy. The credential is used by the `AnsibleJob` resource that is created to initiate the automation. Changes to the Ansible credential in the _Credentials_ section of the console is automatically updated.

After a credential is selected, click the Ansible job drop-down list to select a job template. In the _Extra variables_ section, add the parameter values from the `extra_vars` section of the `PolicyAutomation`. Select the frequency of the automation. You can select _Run once mode_, _Run everyEvent mode_, or _Disable automation_.

Save your policy violation automation by selecting *Submit*. When you select the _View Job_ link from the Ansible job details side panel, the link directs you to the job template on the _Search_ page. After you successfully create the automation, it is displayed in the _Automation_ column.

*Note:* When you delete a policy that has an associated policy automation, the policy automation is automatically deleted as part of clean up.

Your policy violation automation is created from the console.

[#creating-a-policy-violation-auto-cli]
== Creating a policy violation automation from the CLI

Complete the following steps to configure a policy violation automation from the CLI:

. From your terminal, log in to your {product-title-short} hub cluster using the `oc login` command.

. Find or create a policy that you want to add an automation to. Note the policy name and namespace.

. Create a `PolicyAutomation` resource using the following sample as a guide:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: PolicyAutomation
metadata:
  name: policyname-policy-automation
spec:
  automationDef:
    extra_vars:
      your_var: your_value
    name: Policy Compliance Template
    secret: ansible-tower
    type: AnsibleJob
  mode: disabled
  policyRef: policyname
----

. The Automation template name in the previous sample is `Policy Compliance Template`. Change that value to match your job template name.

. In the `extra_vars` section, add any parameters you need to pass to the Automation template.

. Set the mode to either `once`, `everyEvent`, or `disabled`.

. Set the `policyRef` to the name of your policy.

.  Create a secret in the same namespace as this `PolicyAutomation` resource that contains the {aap-short} credential. In the previous example, the secret name is `ansible-tower`. Use the link:../applications/ansible_config.adoc#ansible-secrets[sample from application lifecycle] to see how to create the secret.

. Create the `PolicyAutomation` resource.
+
*Notes:* 

* An immediate run of the policy automation can be initiated by adding the following annotation to the `PolicyAutomation` resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    policy.open-cluster-management.io/rerun: "true"
----

* When the policy is in `once` mode, the automation runs when the policy is non-compliant. The `extra_vars` variable, named `target_clusters` is added and the value is an array of each managed cluster name where the policy is non-compliant.

* When the policy is in `_everyEvent_` mode and the `DelayAfterRunSeconds` exceeds the defined time value, the policy is non-compliant and the automation runs for every policy violation.
