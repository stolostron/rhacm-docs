[#governance]
= Governance

Enterprises must meet internal standards for software engineering, secure engineering, resiliency, security, and regulatory compliance for workloads hosted on private, multi and hybrid clouds. {product-title} governance provides an extensible policy framework for enterprises to introduce their own security policies.

[#governance-architecture]
== Governance architecture

Enhance the security for your cluster with the {product-title} governance lifecycle. The product governance lifecycle is based on defined policies, processes, and procedures to manage security and compliance from a central interface page. View the following diagram of the governance architecture:

The governance architecture is composed of the following components:

* *Governance dashboard*: Provides a summary of your cloud governance and risk details, which include policy and cluster violations. 

+
*Notes:*  

+
** When a policy is propagated to a managed cluster, the replicated policy is named `namespaceName.policyName`. When you create a policy, make sure that the length of the `namespaceName.policyName` must not exceed 63 characters due to the Kubernetes limit for object names.  

** When you search for a policy in the hub cluster, you might also receive the name of the replicated policy on your managed cluster. For example, if you search for `policy-dhaz-cert`, the following policy name from the hub cluster might appear: `default.policy-dhaz-cert`.

* *Policy-based governance framework:* Supports policy creation and deployment to various managed clusters based on attributes associated with clusters, such as a geographical region. See the https://github.com/stolostron/policy-collection[`policy-collection` repository] to view examples of the predefined policies, and instructions on deploying policies to your cluster. You can also contribute custom policy controllers and policies. When policies are violated, automations can be configured to run and take any action that the user chooses. See xref:../governance/ansible_grc.adoc#configuring-governance-ansible[Configuring Ansible Tower for governance] for more information.
+
Use the `policy_governance_info` metric to view trends and analyze any policy failures. See xref:../governance/policy_governance_info.adoc#gov-metric[Governance metric] for more details.

* *Policy controller*: Evaluates one or more policies on the managed cluster against your specified control and generates Kubernetes events for violations. Violations are propagated to the hub cluster. Policy controllers that are included in your installation are the following: Kubernetes configuration, Certificate, and IAM. You can also create a custom policy controller.
* *Open source community*: Supports community contributions with a foundation of the {product-title-short} policy framework. Policy controllers and third-party policies are also a part of the `stolostron/policy-collection` repository. Learn how to contribute and deploy policies using GitOps. For more information, see xref:../governance/deploy_gitops.adoc#deploy-policies-using-gitops[Deploy policies using GitOps]. Learn how to integrate third-party policies with {product-title}. For more information, see xref:../governance/third_party_policy.adoc#integrate-third-party-policy-controllers[Integrate third-party policy controllers].
