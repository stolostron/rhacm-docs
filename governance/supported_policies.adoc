View the following sample configuration policies:

.Table list of configuration policies
|===
| Policy sample | Description

| Namespace policy
| Ensure consistent environment isolation and naming with Namespaces. See the Kubernetes
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/[Namespace documentation].

| Pod policy
| Ensure cluster workload configuration. See the Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/[Pod documentation].

| Memory usage policy
| Limit workload resource usage using Limit Ranges. See the
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/[Limit Range documentation].

| Pod security policy (Deprecated)
| Ensure consistent workload security. See the Kubernetes
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/[Pod security policy documentation].

| Role policy +
Role binding policy
| Manage role permissions and bindings using roles and role bindings. See the Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[RBAC documentation].

| Security content constraints (SCC) policy
| Manage workload permissions with Security Context Constraints. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/authentication_and_authorization/managing-pod-security-policies[Managing Security Context Constraints documentation] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

| ETCD encryption policy
| Ensure data security with etcd encryption. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/security_and_compliance/encrypting-etcd[Encrypting etcd data] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

| Compliance operator policy
| Deploy the Compliance Operator to scan and enforce the compliance state of clusters leveraging OpenSCAP. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/security_and_compliance/compliance-operator#understanding-compliance-operator[Understanding the Compliance Operator] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

| Compliance operator E8 scan
| After applying the Compliance operator policy, deploy an Essential 8 (E8) scan to check for compliance with E8 security profiles. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/security_and_compliance/compliance-operator#understanding-compliance-operator[Understanding the Compliance Operator] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

| Compliance operator CIS scan
| After applying the Compliance operator policy, deploy a Center for Internet Security (CIS) scan to check for compliance with CIS security profiles. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/security_and_compliance/compliance-operator#understanding-compliance-operator[Understanding the Compliance Operator] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

| Image vulnerability policy
| Deploy the Container Security Operator and detect known image vulnerabilities in pods running on the cluster. See the link:https://github.com/quay/container-security-operator#readme[Container Security Operator] GitHub repository.

| {gate} deployment
| Gatekeeper is an admission webhook that enforces custom resource definition-based policies that are run by the Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy engine. See the link:https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/[Gatekeeper] documentation. The {gate} is available for installing Gatekeeper. For more information, see the xref:../governance/gatekeeper_operator/gk_operator_overview.adoc#gk-operator-overview[{gate} overview]

| Gatekeeper compliance policy
| After deploying Gatekeeper to the clusters, deploy this sample Gatekeeper policy that ensures namespaces that are created on the cluster are labeled as specified. For more information, see xref:../governance/gatekeeper_operator/gk_policy_constraints.adoc#integrate-gk-constraints-templates[Integrating Gatekeeper constraints and constraint templates].

| Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus policy set
| Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus is a hybrid-cloud suite of products to securely build, deploy, run, and manage applications for multiple infrastructures. You can deploy Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus to managed clusters using `PolicySets` delivered through a {acm-short} application. For details on OpenShift Platform Plus, see the documentation for link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_platform_plus/4[OpenShift Platform Plus].
