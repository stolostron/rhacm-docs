= Governance architecture

Enhance the security for your cluster with the {product-title} governance lifecycle. The product governance lifecycle is based on using supported policies, processes, and procedures to manage security and compliance from a central interface page. View the following diagram of the governance architecture:

View the following component descriptions for the governance architecture diagram:

- *Policy propagator controller:* Runs on the {product-title-short} hub and is responsible for generating the replicated policies in the managed cluster namespaces on the hub based on the placements bound to the root policy. It also aggregates compliance status from replicated policies to the root policy status. It is also responsible for triggering automations based on policy automations bound to the root policy.

- *Governance policy addon controller:* Runs on the {product-title-short} hub and is responsible for managing the installation of policy controllers on managed clusters.

- *Governance policy framework:* Runs as the `governance-policy-framework` pod on managed clusters and contains the following controllers.
** *Spec sync controller:* Responsible for synchronizing the replicated policy in the managed cluster namespace on the hub to the managed cluster namespace on the managed cluster.

** *Status sync controller:* Responsible for recording compliance events from policy controllers in the replicated policies on the hub and managed cluster. The status only contains updates that are relevant to the current policy and does not consider past statuses if the policy was deleted and recreated.

** *Template sync controller:* Responsible for creating, updating, and deleting objects in the managed cluster namespace on the managed cluster based on the definitions in replicated policy `spec.policy-templates` entries.

** *Gatekeeper sync controller:* Responsible for recording Gatekeeper constraint audit results as compliance events in corresponding {product-title-short} policies.

[#gov-arch-components]
== Governance architecture components

The governance architecture also include following components:

* *Governance dashboard:* Provides a summary of your cloud governance and risk details, which include policy and cluster violations. Refer to the _Manage Governance dashboard_ section to learn about the structure of an {product-title} policy framework, and how to use the {product-title} _Governance_ dashboard.

*Notes:*  
+
** When a policy is propagated to a managed cluster, it is first replicated to the cluster namespace on the hub cluster, and is named and labeled using `namespaceName.policyName`. When you create a policy, make sure that the length of the `namespaceName.policyName` does not exceed 63 characters due to the Kubernetes length limit for label values.

** When you search for a policy in the hub cluster, you might also receive the name of the replicated policy in the managed cluster namespace. For example, if you search for `policy-dhaz-cert` in the `default` namespace, the following policy name from the hub cluster might also appear in the managed cluster namespace: `default.policy-dhaz-cert`.

* *Policy-based governance framework:* Supports policy creation and deployment to various managed clusters based on attributes associated with clusters, such as a geographical region. There are examples of the predefined policies and instructions on deploying policies to your cluster in the _open source community_. Additionally, when policies are violated, automations can be configured to run and take any action that the user chooses. 

* *Open source community:* Supports community contributions with a foundation of the {product-title-short} policy framework. Policy controllers and third-party policies are also a part of the link:https://github.com/open-cluster-management/policy-collection[`open-cluster-management/policy-collection` repository]. You can contribute and deploy policies using GitOps.
