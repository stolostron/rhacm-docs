[#install-operator-with-policy]
= Installing an operator by using the _OperatorPolicy_ resource (Technology Preview)

To install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) operators on your managed clusters, use the `OperatorPolicy` resource. When you have OLM operators on your managed clusters, OLM operators automate the installation processes of your various applications.  

[#create-operator-policy]
== Creating an _OperatorPolicy_ resource to install Quay
To install the Quay operator on to your cluster, run the following command to create and apply the `OperatorPolicy` resource:

----
oc apply -f OperatorPolicy.yaml -n <policy-namespace>
----

Your `OperatorPolicy` resource might resemble the following sample:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: OperatorPolicy
metadata:
  name: install-quay-operator
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce
  severity: medium
  complianceType: musthave
  operatorGroup:
    name: scoped-operator-group
    namespace: quay-operator-ns
    targetNamespaces:
      - quay-operator-ns
  subscription:
    channel: stable-3.8
    name: project-quay
    namespace: quay-operator-ns
    installPlanApproval: Automatic
    source: operatorhubio-catalog
    sourceNamespace: olm
    startingCSV: quay-operator.v3.8.1
----


After you apply a valid `OperatorPolicy` resource, the controller creates the `operatorGroup` and `subscription` objects on the cluster. This prompts OLM to handle the rest of the installation process. The controller reports the health of owned resources in the `.status.Conditions` and `.status.relatedObjects` fields of the `OperatorPolicy` resource on the managed cluster.

To verify that the operator policy is created, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
oc get operatorpolicy install-quay-operator -n <policy-namespace>
----
