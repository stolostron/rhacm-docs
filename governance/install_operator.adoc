[#install-operator-with-policy]
= Installing an operator by using the _OperatorPolicy_ resource

To install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) managed operators on your managed clusters, use an `OperatorPolicy` policy template in a `Policy` definition.  

[#create-operator-policy]
== Creating an _OperatorPolicy_ resource to install Quay

See the following operator policy sample that installs the latest Quay operator in the `stable-3.11` channel using the Red Hat operator catalog:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: install-quay
  namespace: open-cluster-management-global-set
spec:
  disabled: false
  policy-templates:
    - objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
        kind: OperatorPolicy
        metadata:
          name: install-quay
        spec:
          remediationAction: enforce
          severity: critical
          complianceType: musthave
          upgradeApproval: None
          subscription:
            channel: stable-3.11
            installPlanApproval: Automatic
            name: quay-operator
            source: redhat-operators
            sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----

After you add the `OperatorPolicy` policy template, the `operatorGroup` and `subscription` objects are created on the cluster by using the controller. As a result, the rest of the installation is completed by OLM. You can view the health of owned resources in the `.status.Conditions` and `.status.relatedObjects` fields of the `OperatorPolicy` resource on the managed cluster.

To verify the operator policy status, run the following command on your managed cluster:

[source,bash]
----
oc -n <managed cluster namespace> get operatorpolicy install-quay
