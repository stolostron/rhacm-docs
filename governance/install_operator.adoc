[#install-operator-with-policy]
= Installing an operator by using the _OperatorPolicy_ resource (Technology Preview)
//can this be done on hub and managed clusters? | MJ | 03/19/24
Use the `OperatorPolicy` resource to install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) operators on your clusters.

[#create-operator-policy]
== Creating an _OperatorPolicy_ resource to install Quay
//It might be best to provide steps for the console| MJ | 03/19/24
To install Quay on to your cluster, run the following command to create and apply the `OperatorPolicy` resource:

----
need command here
----

Your `OperatorPolicy` resource might resemble the following sample:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: OperatorPolicy
metadata:  
  name: oppol-with-group
spec:  
  remediationAction: enforce # or inform
  severity: medium  
  complianceType: musthave
  operatorGroup: # optional    
    name: scoped-operator-group    
    namespace: operator-policy-testns    
    targetNamespaces:      
      - operator-policy-testns
  subscription:    
    channel: stable-3.8    
    name: project-quay    
    namespace: operator-policy-testns    
    installPlanApproval: Automatic # or manual    
    source: operatorhubio-catalog    
    sourceNamespace: olm    
    startingCSV: quay-operator.v3.8.1
----


After you apply a valid `OperatorPolicy` resource, the controller creates the `operatorGroup` and `subscription` objects on the cluster. This prompts OLM to handle the rest of the installation process. The controller reports the health of owned resources in the `.status.Conditions` and `.status.relatedObjects` fields.
//^ which resource?

To verify that the operator policy is created, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
