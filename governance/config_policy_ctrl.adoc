[#kubernetes-configuration-policy-controller]
= Kubernetes configuration policy controller

Configuration policy controller can be used to configure any Kubernetes resource and apply security policies across your clusters.

The configuration policy controller communicates with the local Kubernetes API server to get the list of your configurations that are in your cluster.
For more information about CRDs, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[Extend the Kubernetes API with CustomResourceDefinitions].

The configuration policy controller is created on the hub cluster during installation.
Configuration policy controller supports the `enforce` feature and monitors the compliance of the following policies:

When the `remediationAction` for the configuration policy is set to `enforce`, the controller creates a replicate policy on the target managed clusters. You can also use templates in configuration policies. For more information, see xref:../governance/custom_template.adoc#support-templates-in-config-policies[Support for templates in configuration policies].

.Parameter table
|===
| Field | Description

| apiVersion
| Required.
Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| kind
| Required.
Set the value to `ConfigurationPolicy` to indicate the type of policy.

| metadata.name
| Required. The name of the policy.

| spec
| Required.
Specifications of which configuration policy to monitor and how to remediate them.

| spec.namespace
| Required for namespaced objects or resources. The namespaces in the hub cluster that the policy is applied to.
Enter at least one namespace for the `include` parameter, which are the namespaces you want to apply to the policy to.
The `exclude` parameter specifies the namespaces you explicitly do not want to apply the policy to.

| spec.remediationAction
| Required. Specifies the remediation of your policy. Enter  `inform`

| spec.remediationAction.severity
| Required. Specifies the severity when the policy is non-compliant. Use the following parameter values: `low`, `medium`, or `high`.

| spec.remediationAction.complianceType
| Required. Used to list expected behavior for roles and other Kubernetes object that must be evaluated or applied to the managed clusters. You must use the following verbs as parameter values:

`mustonlyhave`: Indicates that an object must exist with the exact name and relevant fields.

`musthave`: Indicates an object must exist with the same name as specified object-template. The other fields in the template are a subset of what exists in the object.

`mustnothave`: Indicated that an object with the same name or labels cannot exist and need to be deleted, regardless of the specification or rules.

| spec.evaluationInterval.compliant
| Optional. Used to define how often the policy is evaluated when it is in the compliant state. The values must be in the format of a duration which is a sequence of numbers with time unit suffixes. For example, `12h30m5s` represents 12 hours, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds. It can also be set to `never` so that the policy is not reevaluated on the compliant cluster, unless the policy `spec` is updated.

| spec.evaluationInterval.noncompliant
| Optional. Used to define how often the policy is evaluated when it is in the non-compliant state. Similar to the `evaluationInterval.compliant` parameter, the values must be in the format of a duration which is a sequence of numbers with time unit suffixes. It can also be set to `never` so that the policy is not reevaluated on the noncompliant cluster, unless the policy `spec` is updated.
