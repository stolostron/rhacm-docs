[#kubernetes-config-policy-controller]
= Kubernetes configuration policy controller

The configuration policy controller can be used to configure any Kubernetes resource and apply security policies across your clusters. The configuration policy is provided in the `policy-templates` field of the policy on the hub cluster, and is propagated to the selected managed clusters by the governance framework. 

A Kubernetes object is defined (in whole or in part) in the `object-templates` array in the configuration policy, indicating to the configuration policy controller of the fields to compare with objects on the managed cluster. The configuration policy controller communicates with the local Kubernetes API server to get the list of your configurations that are in your cluster.

The configuration policy controller is created on the managed cluster during installation. The configuration policy controller supports the `enforce` and the `InformOnly` feature to remediate when the configuration policy is non-compliant. 

When the `remediationAction` for the configuration policy is set to `enforce`, the controller applies the specified configuration to the target managed cluster. 

When the `remediationAction` for the configuration policy is set to `InformOnly`, the parent policy does not enforce the configuration policy, even if the `remediationAction` in the parent policy is set to `enforce`.

*Note:* Configuration policies that specify an object without a name can only be `inform`.

You can also use templated values within configuration policies. For more information, see _Template processing_.

If you have existing Kubernetes manifests that you want to put in a policy, the Policy Generator is a useful tool to accomplish this.

[#configuration-policy-yaml-table]
== Configuration policy YAML table

.Parameter table
|===
| Field | Optional or required | Description

| `apiVersion`
| Required
| Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| `kind`
| Required
| Set the value to `ConfigurationPolicy` to indicate the type of policy.

| `metadata.name`
| Required
| The name of the policy.

| `spec.namespaceSelector`
| Required for namespaced objects that do not have a namespace specified
| Determines namespaces in the managed cluster that the object is applied to. The `include` and `exclude` parameters accept file path expressions to include and exclude namespaces by name. The `matchExpressions` and `matchLabels` parameters specify namespaces to include by label. See the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/[Kubernetes labels and selectors] documentation. The resulting list is compiled by using the intersection of results from all parameters.

| `spec.remediationAction`
| Required
| Specifies the action to take when the policy is non-compliant. Use the following parameter values: `inform`, `InformOnly`, or `enforce`.

| `spec.severity`
| Required
| Specifies the severity when the policy is non-compliant. Use the following parameter values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`.

| `spec.evaluationInterval.compliant`
| Optional
| Used to define how often the policy is evaluated when it is in the compliant state. The values must be in the format of a duration which is a sequence of numbers with time unit suffixes. For example, `12h30m5s` represents 12 hours, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds. It can also be set to `never` so that the policy is not reevaluated on the compliant cluster, unless the policy `spec` is updated. 

By default, the minimum time between evaluations for configuration policies is approximately 10 seconds when the `evaluationInterval.compliant` is not set or empty. This can be longer if the configuration policy controller is saturated on the managed cluster. 

| `spec.evaluationInterval.noncompliant`
| Optional
| Used to define how often the policy is evaluated when it is in the non-compliant state. Similar to the `evaluationInterval.compliant` parameter, the values must be in the format of a duration which is a sequence of numbers with time unit suffixes. It can also be set to `never` so that the policy is not reevaluated on the non-compliant cluster, unless the policy `spec` is updated.

| `spec.object-templates`
| Optional
| The array of Kubernetes objects (either fully defined or containing a subset of fields) for the controller to compare with objects on the managed cluster. *Note:* While `spec.object-templates` and `spec.object-templates-raw` are listed as optional, exactly one of the two parameter fields must be set.

| `spec.object-templates-raw`
| Optional
| Used to set object templates with a raw YAML string. Specify conditions for the object templates, where advanced functions like if-else statements and the `range` function are supported values. For example, add the following value to avoid duplication in your `object-templates` definition:


`{{- if eq .metadata.name "policy-grc-your-meta-data-name" }}
                  replicas: 2
 {{- else }}
                  replicas: 1
 {{- end }}`
 
 *Note:* While `spec.object-templates` and `spec.object-templates-raw` are listed as optional, exactly one of the two parameter fields must be set. 

| `spec.object-templates[].complianceType`
| Required
| Used to define the desired state of the Kubernetes object on the managed clusters. You must use one of the following verbs as the parameter value:

`mustonlyhave`: Indicates that an object must exist with the exact fields and values as defined in the `objectDefinition`.

`musthave`: Indicates an object must exist with the same fields as specified in the `objectDefinition`. Any existing fields on the object that are not specified in the `object-template` are ignored. In general, array values are appended. The exception for the array to be patched is when the item contains a `name` key with a value that matches an existing item. Use a fully defined `objectDefinition` using the `mustonlyhave` compliance type, if you want to replace the array.

`mustnothave`: Indicates that an object with the same fields as specified in the `objectDefinition` cannot exist.

| `spec.object-templates[].metadataComplianceType`
| Optional
| Overrides `spec.object-templates[].complianceType` when comparing the manifest's metadata section to objects on the cluster ("musthave", "mustonlyhave"). Default is unset to not override `complianceType` for metadata.

| `spec.object-templates[].objectDefinition`
| Required
| A Kubernetes object (either fully defined or containing a subset of fields) for the controller to compare with objects on the managed cluster.

| `spec.pruneObjectBehavior`
| Optional
| Determines whether to clean up resources related to the policy when the policy is removed from a managed cluster.
