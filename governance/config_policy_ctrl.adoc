[#kubernetes-configuration-policy-controller]
= Kubernetes configuration policy controller

Configuration policy controller can be used to configure any Kubernetes resource and apply security policies across your clusters. The configuration policy is provided in the `policy-templates` field of the policy on the hub and is propagated to the selected managed clusters by the governance framework. See the xref:../governance/policy_example.adoc#policy-yaml-structure[policy YAML documentation] for more about the hub policy.

A Kubernetes object is defined (in whole or in part) in the `object-templates` array in the configuration policy, indicating to the configuration policy controller on the fields to compare with objects on the managed cluster. The configuration policy controller communicates with the local Kubernetes API server to get the list of your configurations that are in your cluster. For more information about CRDs, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[Extend the Kubernetes API with CustomResourceDefinitions].

The configuration policy controller is created on the managed cluster during installation. Configuration policy controller supports the `enforce` feature to remediate when the configuration policy becomes NonCompliant. When the `remediationAction` for the configuration policy is set to `enforce`, the controller applies the specified configuration to the target managed cluster.

You can also use templated values within the configuration policies. For more information, see xref:../governance/custom_template.adoc#support-templates-in-config-policies[Support for templates in configuration policies].

If you have existing Kubernetes manifests that you want to put in a policy, the xref:../governance/policy_generator.adoc[policy generator] is a useful tool to accomplish this.

[#configuration-policy-yaml-table]
== Configuration policy YAML table

.Parameter table
|===
| Field | Optional or required | Description

| `apiVersion`
| Required
| Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| `kind`
| Required
| Set the value to `ConfigurationPolicy` to indicate the type of policy.

| `metadata.name`
| Required
| The name of the policy.

| `spec.namespaceSelector`
| Required for namespaced objects that do not have a namespace specified
| Determines namespaces in the managed cluster that the object is applied to. The `include` and `exclude` parameters accept filepath expressions to include and exclude namespaces by name. The `matchExpressions` and `matchLabels` parameters specify namespaces to include by label. (See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/[Kubernetes labels and selectors] documentation.) The resulting list is compiled by using the intersection of results from all parameters.

| `spec.remediationAction`
| Required
| Specifies the action to take when the policy becomes NonCompliant. Use the following parameter values: `inform` or `enforce`.

| `spec.severity`
| Required
| Specifies the severity when the policy is non-compliant. Use the following parameter values: `low`, `medium`, or `high`.

| `spec.evaluationInterval.compliant`
| Optional
| Used to define how often the policy is evaluated when it is in the compliant state. The values must be in the format of a duration which is a sequence of numbers with time unit suffixes. For example, `12h30m5s` represents 12 hours, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds. It can also be set to `never` so that the policy is not reevaluated on the compliant cluster, unless the policy `spec` is updated.

| `spec.evaluationInterval.noncompliant`
| Optional
| Used to define how often the policy is evaluated when it is in the non-compliant state. Similar to the `evaluationInterval.compliant` parameter, the values must be in the format of a duration which is a sequence of numbers with time unit suffixes. It can also be set to `never` so that the policy is not reevaluated on the noncompliant cluster, unless the policy `spec` is updated.

| `spec.object-templates`
| Required
| The array of Kubernetes objects (either fully defined or containing a subset of fields) for the controller to compare with objects on the managed cluster.

| `spec.object-templates[].complianceType`
| Required
| Used to list expected behavior for roles and other Kubernetes object that must be evaluated or applied to the managed clusters. You must use the following verbs as parameter values:

`mustonlyhave`: Indicates that an object must exist with the exact fields and values as defined in the object.

`musthave`: Indicates an object must exist with the same fields as specified in the objectDefinition. The fields in the template are a subset of what exists in the object. In general, array values are appended. The exception is the array will be patched when the item contains a `name` key with a value that matches an existing item. If the array should be replaced, use a fully defined `objectDefinition` using the `mustonlyhave` compliance type.

`mustnothave`: Indicates that an object with the same fields as specified in the objectDefinition cannot exist.

| `spec.object-templates[].metadataComplianceType`
| Optional
| Overrides `spec.object-templates[].complianceType` when comparing the manifest's metadata section to objects on the cluster ("musthave", "mustonlyhave"). Default is unset to not override `complianceType` for metadata.

| `spec.object-templates[].objectDefinition`
| Required
| A Kubernetes object (either fully defined or containing a subset of fields) for the controller to compare with objects on the managed cluster.

[#configuration-config-policy-controller]
== Configuring the configuration policy controller

You can configure the concurrency of the configuration policy controller per managed cluster to change how many configuration policies it can evaluate at the same time. To change the default value of `2`, set the `policy-evaluation-concurrency` annotation with a non-zero integer within quotes. You can set the value on the `ManagedClusterAddOn` object called `config-policy-controller` in the managed cluster namespace of the hub.

*Note*: Higher concurrency values increase CPU and memory utilization on the `config-policy-controller` pod, Kubernetes API server, and OpenShift API server.

In the following YAML example, concurrency is set to `5` on the managed cluster called `cluster1`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  name: config-policy-controller
  namespace: cluster1
  annotations:
    policy-evaluation-concurrency: "5"
spec:
  installNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
