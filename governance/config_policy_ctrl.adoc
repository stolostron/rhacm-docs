[#kubernetes-config-policy-controller]
= Kubernetes configuration policy controller

The configuration policy controller can be used to configure any Kubernetes resource and apply security policies across your clusters. The configuration policy controller communicates with the local Kubernetes API server to get the list of your configurations that are in your cluster.

This policy controller is created on the managed cluster during installation. The configuration policy is provided in the `policy-templates` field of the policy on the hub cluster, and is propagated to the selected managed clusters by the governance framework.

When the `remediationAction` for the configuration policy controller is set to `InformOnly`, the parent policy does not enforce the configuration policy, even if the `remediationAction` in the parent policy is set to `enforce`.

If you have existing Kubernetes manifests that you want to put in a policy, the Policy Generator is a useful tool to accomplish this.

<1> Configuration policies that specify an object without a name can only be set to `inform`. When the `remediationAction` for the configuration policy is set to `enforce`, the controller applies the specified configuration to the target managed cluster.
<2> A Kubernetes object is defined in the `object-templates` array in the configuration policy, where fields of the configuration policy controller is compared with objects on the managed cluster. You can also use templated values within configuration policies. For more information, see _Template processing_.

[#configuration-policy-yaml-table]
== Configuration policy YAML table

.Parameter table
|===
| Field | Optional or required | Description

| `apiVersion`
| Required
| Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| `kind`
| Required
| Set the value to `ConfigurationPolicy` to indicate the type of policy.

| `metadata.name`
| Required
| The name of the policy.

| `spec.namespaceSelector`
| Required for namespaced objects that do not have a namespace specified
| Determines namespaces in the managed cluster that the object is applied to. The `include` and `exclude` parameters accept file path expressions to include and exclude namespaces by name. The `matchExpressions` and `matchLabels` parameters specify namespaces to include by label. See the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/[Kubernetes labels and selectors] documentation. The resulting list is compiled by using the intersection of results from all parameters.

| `spec.remediationAction`
| Required
| Specifies the action to take when the policy is non-compliant. Use the following parameter values: `inform`, `InformOnly`, or `enforce`.

| `spec.customMessage`
| Optional
| Based on the current compliance, this section is used to configure the compliance messages sent by the configuration policy to use one of the specified Go templates. You can use the default message from the `.DefaultMessage` parameter and `.Policy` object variable of the current state of the policy from the configuration policy controller. The state of each related object is available at the `.Policy.status.relatedObjects[*].object` parameter section of the configuration policy controller. If you set an `evaluationInterval`, only identifiable information is available.

| `spec.customMessage.compliant`
| Optional
| Use this field to configure custom messages for configuration policies that are compliant. UTF-8 encoded characters, including emoji and foreign characters are supported values.

| `spec.customMessage.noncompliant`
| Optional
| Use this field to configure custom messages for configuration policies that are non-compliant. UTF-8 encoded characters, along with emoji and foreign characters are supported values.

| `spec.severity`
| Required
| Specifies the severity when the policy is non-compliant. Use the following parameter values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`.

| `spec.evaluationInterval.compliant`
| Optional
| Used to define how often the policy is evaluated when it is in the compliant state. The values must be in the format of a duration which is a sequence of numbers with time unit suffixes. For example, `12h30m5s` represents 12 hours, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds. It can also be set to `never` so that the policy is not reevaluated on the compliant cluster, unless the policy `spec` is updated. 

By default, the minimum time between evaluations for configuration policies is approximately 10 seconds when the `evaluationInterval.compliant` is not set or empty. This can be longer if the configuration policy controller is saturated on the managed cluster. 

| `spec.evaluationInterval.noncompliant`
| Optional
| Used to define how often the policy is evaluated when it is in the non-compliant state. Similar to the `evaluationInterval.compliant` parameter, the values must be in the format of a duration which is a sequence of numbers with time unit suffixes. It can also be set to `never` so that the policy is not reevaluated on the non-compliant cluster, unless the policy `spec` is updated.

| `spec.object-templates`
| Optional
| The array of Kubernetes objects (either fully defined or containing a subset of fields) for the controller to compare with objects on the managed cluster. *Note:* While `spec.object-templates` and `spec.object-templates-raw` are listed as optional, exactly one of the two parameter fields must be set.

| `spec.object-templates-raw`
| Optional
| Used to set object templates with a raw YAML string. Specify conditions for the object templates, where advanced functions like if-else statements and the `range` function are supported values. For example, add the following value to avoid duplication in your `object-templates` definition:


`{{- if eq .metadata.name "policy-grc-your-meta-data-name" }}
                  replicas: 2
 {{- else }}
                  replicas: 1
 {{- end }}`
 
 *Note:* While `spec.object-templates` and `spec.object-templates-raw` are listed as optional, exactly one of the two parameter fields must be set. 

| `spec.object-templates[].complianceType`
| Required
a| Use this parameter to define the desired state of the Kubernetes object on your managed clusters. Use one of the following verbs as the parameter value:

- `mustonlyhave`: Indicates that an object must exist with the exact fields and values as defined in the `objectDefinition`.

- `musthave`: Indicates an object must exist with the same fields as specified in the `objectDefinition`. Any existing fields on the object that are not specified in the `object-template` are ignored. In general, array values are appended. The exception for the array to be patched is when the item contains a `name` key with a value that matches an existing item. Use a fully defined `objectDefinition` using the `mustonlyhave` compliance type, if you want to replace the array.

- `mustnothave`: Indicates that an object with the same fields as specified in the `objectDefinition` cannot exist.

| `spec.object-templates[].metadataComplianceType`
| Optional
| Overrides `spec.object-templates[].complianceType` when comparing the manifest's metadata section to objects on the cluster ("musthave", "mustonlyhave"). Default is unset to not override `complianceType` for metadata.

| `spec.object-templates[].recordDiff`
| Optional
a| Use this parameter to specify if and where to display the difference between the object on the cluster and the `objectDefinition` in the policy. The following options are supported:

- Set to `InStatus` to store the difference in the `ConfigurationPolicy` status.
- Set to `Log` to log the difference in the controller logs.
- Set to `None` to not log the difference. 

By default, this parameter is set to `InStatus` if the controller does not detect sensitive data in the difference. Otherwise, the default is `None`. If sensitive data is detected, the `ConfigurationPolicy` status displays a message to set `recordDiff` to view the difference.

| `spec.object-templates[].recreateOption`
| Optional
| Describes when to delete and recreate an object when an update is required. When you set the object to `IfRequired`, the policy recreates the object when updating an immutable field. When you set the parameter to `Always`, the policy recreates the object on any update. When you set the `remediationAction` to `inform`, the parameter value, `recreateOption`, has no effect on the object. The `IfRequired` value has no effect on clusters without dry-run update support. The default value is `None`.

| `spec.object-templates[].objectDefinition`
| Required
| A Kubernetes object (either fully defined or containing a subset of fields) for the controller to compare with objects on the managed cluster.

| `spec.pruneObjectBehavior`
| Optional
| Determines whether to clean up resources related to the policy when the policy is removed from a managed cluster.
