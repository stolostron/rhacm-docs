[#creating-a-security-policy]
== Creating a security policy

You can create a security policy from the command line interface (CLI) or from the console.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

*Important:*
* You must define a placement and placement binding to apply your policy to a specific cluster. The `PlacementBinding` resource binds the placement. Enter a valid value for the cluster _Label selector_ field to define a `Placement` and `PlacementBinding` resource.
* In order to use a `Placement` resource, a `ManagedClusterSet` resource must be bound to the namespace of the `Placement` resource with a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource. Refer to link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/create_clustersetbinding.adoc#creating-managedclustersetbinding[Creating a _ManagedClusterSetBinding_ resource] for additional details.  

[#creating-a-security-policy-from-the-command-line-interface]
=== Creating a security policy from the command line interface

Complete the following steps to create a policy from the command line interface (CLI):

. Create a policy by running the following command:
+
----
oc create -f policy.yaml -n <policy-namespace>
----

. Define the template that the policy uses. Edit your YAML file by adding a `policy-templates` field to define a template. Your policy might resemble the following YAML file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: policy1
spec:
  remediationAction: "enforce" # or inform
  disabled: false # or true
  namespaceSelector:
    include:
    - "default"
    - "my-namespace"
  policy-templates:
    - objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
        kind: ConfigurationPolicy
        metadata:
          name: operator
          # namespace: # will be supplied by the controller via the namespaceSelector
        spec:
          remediationAction: "inform"
          object-templates:
          - complianceType: "musthave" # at this level, it means the role must exist and must have the following rules
            apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
            kind: Role
            metadata:
              name: example
            objectDefinition:
              rules:
                - complianceType: "musthave" # at this level, it means if the role exists the rule is a musthave
                  apiGroups: ["extensions", "apps"]
                  resources: ["deployments"]
                  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "delete","patch"]
----

. Define a `PlacementBinding` resource to bind your policy to your `Placement` resource. Your `PlacementBinding` resource might resemble the following YAML sample:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementBinding
metadata:
  name: binding1
placementRef:
  name: placement1
  apiGroup: cluster.open-cluster-management.io
  kind: Placement
subjects:
- name: policy1
  apiGroup: policy.open-cluster-management.io
  kind: Policy
----

==== Viewing your security policy from the CLI

Complete the following steps to view your security policy from the CLI:

. View details for a specific security policy by running the following command:
+
----
oc get policies.policy.open-cluster-management.io <policy-name> -n <policy-namespace> -o yaml

[#creating-a-cluster-security-policy-from-the-console]
=== Creating a cluster security policy from the console

After you log in to your {acm-short}, navigate to the _Governance_ page and click *Create policy*. As you create your new policy from the console, a YAML file is also created in the YAML editor. To view the YAML editor, select the toggle at the beginning of the _Create policy_ form to enable it.

. *Optional:* Add a description for your policy. 
. Click *Create Policy*. A security policy is created from the console.

[#viewing-your-security-policy-from-the-console]
==== Viewing your security policy from the console

View any security policy and the status from the console.

. Navigate to the _Governance_ page to view a table list of your policies. *Note:* You can filter the table list of your policies by selecting the _Policies_ tab or _Cluster violations_ tab.

[#creating-policy-sets-cli]

By default, the policy set is created with no policies or placements. You must create a placement for the policy set and have at least one policy that exists on your cluster. When you create a policy set, you can add numerous policies. 

Run the following command to create a policy set from the CLI:

----
oc apply -f <policyset-filename>
----

[#creating-policy-sets-ui]
=== Creating policy sets from the console

. From the navigation menu, select *Governance*. 

. Select the _Policy sets_ tab. 

. Select the *Create policy set* button and complete the form. 

. Add the details for your policy set and select the *Submit* button.

Your policy is listed from the policy table. 

[#updating-security-policies]
== Updating security policies

Learn to update security policies.

[#adding-policy-set-cli]
=== Adding a policy to a policy set from the CLI

. Run the following command to edit your policy set: 

+
----
oc edit policysets <your-policyset-name>
----

. Add the policy name to the list in the `policies` section of the policy set. 

. Apply your added policy in the placement section of your policy set with the following command: 

----
oc apply -f <your-added-policy.yaml>
----

`PlacementBinding` and `Placement` are both created. 

*Note:* If you delete the placement binding, the policy is still placed by the policy set.

[#adding-a-policy-ui]
=== Adding a policy to a policy set from the console

. Add a policy to the policy set by selecting the _Policy sets_ tab. 

. Select the Actions icon and select *Edit*. The _Edit policy set_ form appears.

. Navigate to the _Policies_ section of the form to select a policy to add to the policy set. 

[#disabling-security-policies]
=== Disabling security policies

Your policy is enabled by default. Disable your policy from the console.

After you log in to your {acm} console, navigate to the _Governance_ page to view a table list of your policies.

Select the *Actions* icon > *Disable policy*. The _Disable Policy_ dialog box appears.

Click *Disable policy*. Your policy is disabled.

[#deleting-a-security-policy]
== Deleting a security policy

Delete a security policy from the CLI or the console.

* Delete a security policy from the CLI:
.. Delete a security policy by running the following command:
+
----
oc delete policies.policy.open-cluster-management.io <policy-name> -n <policy-namespace>
----
+
After your policy is deleted, it is removed from your target cluster or clusters. Verify that your policy is removed by running the following command: `oc get policies.policy.open-cluster-management.io <policy-name> -n <policy-namespace>`

* Delete a security policy from the console:
+
From the navigation menu, click *Governance* to view a table list of your policies. Click the *Actions* icon for the policy you want to delete in the policy violation table.
+
Click *Remove*. From the _Remove policy_ dialog box, click *Remove policy*.

[#deleting-policy-sets]

. From the _Policy sets_ tab, select the *Actions* icon for the policy set. When you click *Delete*, the _Permanently delete Policyset?_ dialogue box appears. 

. Click the *Delete* button.

[#cleaning-up-resources-from-policies]
== Cleaning up resources that are created by policies

Use the `pruneObjectBehavior` parameter in a configuration policy to clean up resources that are created by the policy. When `pruneObjectBehavior` is set, the related objects are only cleaned up after the configuration policy (or parent policy) associated with them is deleted. 

View the following descriptions of the values that can be used for the parameter:

* `DeleteIfCreated`: Cleans up any resources created by the policy.
* `DeleteAll`: Cleans up all resources managed by the policy.
* `None`: This is the default value and maintains the same behavior from previous releases, where no related resources are deleted.

You can set the value directly in the YAML file as you create a policy from the command line. 

From the console, you can select the value in the _Prune Object Behavior_ section of the _Policy templates_ step.

*Notes:*

- If a policy that installs an operator has the `pruneObjectBehavior` parameter defined, then additional clean up is needed to complete the operator uninstall. You might need to delete the operator `ClusterServiceVersion` object as part of this cleanup.

- As you disable the `config-policy-addon` resource on the managed cluster, the `pruneObjbectBehavior` is ignored. To automatically clean up the related resources on the policies, you must remove the policies from the managed cluster before the add-on is disabled.
