= Template processing introduction

Configuration policies support the inclusion of Golang text templates in the object definitions. These templates are resolved at runtime either on the hub cluster or the target managed cluster using configurations related to that cluster. This gives you the ability to define configuration policies with dynamic content, and inform or enforce Kubernetes resources that are customized to the target cluster.

A configuration policy definition can contain both hub cluster and managed cluster templates. Hub cluster templates are processed first on the hub cluster, then the policy definition with resolved hub cluster templates is propagated to the target clusters. On the managed cluster, the `ConfigurationPolicyController` processes any managed cluster templates in the policy definition and then enforces or verifies the fully resolved object definition.

The template syntax must be conformed to the Golang template language specification, and the resource definition generated from the resolved template must be a valid YAML. See the Golang documentation about _Package templates_ for more information. Any errors in template validation are recognized as policy violations. When you use a custom template function, the values are replaced at runtime.

*Important:* If you use hub cluster templates to propagate secrets or other sensitive data, the sensitive data exists in the managed cluster namespace on the hub cluster and on the managed clusters where that policy is distributed. The template content is expanded in the policy, and policies are not encrypted by the {ocp-short} ETCD encryption support. To address this, use `fromSecret` or `copySecretData`, which automatically encrypts the values from the secret, or `protect` to encrypt other values.

See the following table for a comparison of hub cluster and managed cluster templates:

== Comparison of hub cluster and managed cluster templates

.Comparison table
|===
| Templates | Hub cluster | Managed cluster 

| Syntax
| Golang text template specification
| Golang text template specification

| Delimiter
| {{hub … hub}}
| {{ … }}

| Context
| A `.ManagedClusterName` variable is available, which at runtime, resolves to the name of the target cluster where the policy is propagated. The `.ManagedClusterLabels` variable is also available, which resolves to a map of keys and values of the labels on the managed cluster where the policy is propagated.
| No context variables

| Access control
| You can only reference namespaced Kubernetes objects that are in the same namespace as the `Policy` resource.
| You can reference any resource on the cluster.

| Functions
| A set of template functions that support dynamic access to Kubernetes resources and string manipulation. See _Template functions_ for more information. See the Access control row for lookup restrictions.

The `fromSecret` template function on the hub cluster stores the resulting value as an encrypted string on the replicated policy, in the managed cluster namespace. 

The equivalent call might use the following syntax: `{{hub "(lookup "v1" "Secret" "default" "my-hub-secret").data.message \| protect hub}}`
| A set of template functions support dynamic access to Kubernetes resources and string manipulation. See _Template functions_ for more information.

| Function output storage
| The output of template functions are stored in `Policy` resource objects in each applicable managed cluster namespace on the hub cluster, before it is synced to the managed cluster. This means that any sensitive results from template functions are readable by anyone with read access to the `Policy` resource objects on the hub cluster, and read access with `ConfigurationPolicy` resource objects on the managed clusters. Additionally, if etcd encryption is enabled, the `Policy` and `ConfigurationPolicy` resource objects are not encrypted. It is best to carefully consider this when using template functions that return sensitive output (e.g. from a secret).
| The output of template functions are not stored in policy related resource objects.

| Processing
| Processing occurs at runtime on the hub cluster during propagation of replicated policies to clusters. Policies and the hub cluster templates within the policies are processed on the hub cluster only when templates are created or updated.
| Processing occurs in the `ConfigurationPolicyController` on the managed cluster. Policies are processed periodically, which automatically updates the resolved object definition with data in the referenced resources.

| Processing errors
| Errors from the hub cluster templates are displayed as violations on the managed clusters the policy applies to.
| Errors from the managed cluster templates are displayed as violations on the specific target cluster where the violation occurred.
