= Gatekeeper operator 

Gatekeeper is a validating webhook with auditing capabilities that can enforce custom resource definition-based policies that are run with the Open Policy Agent (OPA). You can install Gatekeeper on your cluster by using the Gatekeeper operator policy. Gatekeeper constraints can be used to evaluate Kubernetes resource compliance. You can leverage OPA as the policy engine, and use Rego as the policy language.

*Prerequisite:* A {product-title} or {ocp} Plus subscription is required to install Gatekeeper and apply Gatekeeper policies to your cluster. Gatekeeper is supported only on {ocp-short} versions, except version 3.11, supported by the latest version of {product-title-short}.
