[#e8-scan-policy]
= E8 scan policy

An Essential 8 (E8) scan policy deploys a scan that checks the master and worker nodes for compliance with the E8 security profiles. You must install the compliance operator to apply the E8 scan policy.

The E8 scan policy is created as a Kubernetes configuration policy in {product-title-short}. {ocp-short} 4.7 and 4.6, support the E8 scan policy. For more information, see _Understanding the Compliance Operator_ in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-understanding.html[{ocp-short} documentation] for more details.

[#e8-scan-policy-resources]
== E8 scan policy resources

When you create an E8 scan policy the following resources are created:

- A `ScanSettingBinding` resource (`e8`) to identify which profiles to scan:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: compliance-suite-e8
spec:
  remediationAction: inform
  severity: high
  object-templates:
    - complianceType: musthave # this template checks if scan has completed by checking the status field
      objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
        kind: ScanSettingBinding
        metadata:
          name: e8 
          namespace: openshift-compliance
        profiles:
        - apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Profile
          name: ocp4-e8
        - apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Profile
          name: rhcos4-e8
        settingsRef:
          apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
          kind: ScanSetting
          name: default
----

- A `ComplianceSuite` resource (`compliance-suite-e8`) to verify if the scan is complete by checking the `status` field:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: compliance-suite-e8
spec:
  remediationAction: inform
  severity: high
  object-templates:
    - complianceType: musthave # this template checks if scan has completed by checking the status field
      objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
        kind: ComplianceSuite
        metadata:
          name: e8
          namespace: openshift-compliance
        status:
          phase: DONE
----

- A `ComplianceCheckResult` resource (`compliance-suite-e8-results`) which reports the results of the scan suite by checking the `ComplianceCheckResult` custom resources (CR):

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: compliance-suite-e8-results
spec:
  remediationAction: inform
  severity: high
  object-templates:
    - complianceType: mustnothave # this template reports the results for scan suite: e8 by looking at ComplianceCheckResult CRs
      objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
        kind: ComplianceCheckResult
        metadata:
          namespace: openshift-compliance
          labels:
            compliance.openshift.io/check-status: FAIL
            compliance.openshift.io/suite: e8
----

*Note:* Automatic remediation is supported. Set the remediation action to `enforce` to create `ScanSettingBinding` resource. 

See a sample of the https://github.com/stolostron/policy-collection/blob/main/stable/CM-Configuration-Management/policy-compliance-operator-e8-scan.yaml[`policy-compliance-operator-e8-scan.yaml`]. See xref:../governance/create_policy.adoc#managing-security-policies[Managing security policies] for more information. *Note*: After your E8 policy is deleted, it is removed from your target cluster or clusters.
