[#policy-controller-advanced-config]
= Policy controller advanced configuration 

You can customize policy controller configurations on your managed clusters using the `ManagedClusterAddOn` custom resources. The following custom resources are included in the `ManagedClusterAddOn` resource, `overnance-policy-framework`, `config-policy-controller`, `cert-policy-controller`, and `iam-policy-controller`.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#configure-config-policy-controller] 
== Configure the configuration policy controller

You can configure the concurrency of the configuration policy controller for each managed cluster to change how many configuration policies it can evaluate at the same time. To change the default value of `2`, set the `policy-evaluation-concurrency` annotation with a non-zero integer within quotes. You can set the value on the `ManagedClusterAddOn` object called `config-policy-controller` in the managed cluster namespace of the hub cluster.

*Note:* Higher concurrency values increase CPU and memory utilization on the `config-policy-controller` pod, Kubernetes API server, and OpenShift API server.

In the following YAML example, concurrency is set to `5` on the managed cluster called `cluster1`:
