[#policy-controller-advanced-config]
= Policy controller advanced configuration 

You can customize policy controller configurations on your managed clusters by using the `ManagedClusterAddOn` custom resources. The following `ManagedClusterAddOns` configure the policy framework, `governance-policy-framework`, `config-policy-controller`, `cert-policy-controller`, and `iam-policy-controller`.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#configure-concurrency] 
== Configure the concurrency

You can configure the concurrency of the configuration policy controller for each managed cluster to change how many configuration policies it can evaluate at the same time. To change the default value of `2`, set the `policy-evaluation-concurrency` annotation with a non-zero integer within quotation marks. You can set the value on the `ManagedClusterAddOn` object name to `config-policy-controller` in the managed cluster namespace of the hub cluster.

*Note:* Increased concurrency values increase CPU and memory utilization on the `config-policy-controller` pod, Kubernetes API server, and OpenShift API server.

In the following YAML example, concurrency is set to `5` on the managed cluster that is named `cluster1`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  name: config-policy-controller
  namespace: cluster1
  annotations:
    policy-evaluation-concurrency: "5"
spec:
  installNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

[#configure-qps-rates] 
== Configure the rate of requests to the API server

Configure the rate of requests to the API server that the configuration policy controller makes on each managed cluster. An increased rate improves the responsiveness of the configuration policy controller, which also increases the CPU and memory utilization of the Kubernetes API server and OpenShift API server. By default, the rate of requests scales with the `policy-evaluation-concurrency` setting and is set to `30` queries for each second (QPS), with a `45` burst value, representing a higher number of requests over short periods of time.

You can configure the rate and burst by setting the `client-qps` and `client-burst` annotations with non-zero integers within quotation marks. You can set the value on the `ManagedClusterAddOn` object name to `config-policy-controller` in the managed cluster namespace of the hub cluster.

In the following YAML example, the queries for each second is set to `20` and the burst is set to `100` on the managed cluster called `cluster1`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  name: config-policy-controller
  namespace: cluster1
  annotations:
    client-qps: "20"
    client-burst: "100"
spec:
  installNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

[#configure-debug-log] 
== Configure debug log 

Configure debug logs for each policy controller. To receive the second level of debugging information for the Kubernetes configuration controller, add the `log-level` annotation with the value of `2` to the `ManagedClusterAddOn` custom resource. By default, the `log-level` is set to `0`, which means you receive informative messages. View the following example:  

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  name: config-policy-controller
  namespace: cluster1
  annotations:
    log-level: "2"
spec:
  installNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

[#gov-metric]
== Governance metric

The policy framework exposes metrics that show policy distribution and compliance. Use the `policy_governance_info` metric on the hub cluster to view trends and analyze any policy failures. See the following topics for an overview of metrics:

[#metric-policy-governance-info]
=== Metric: policy_governance_info

The `policy_governance_info` is collected by the {ocp-short} monitoring feature, and some aggregate data is collected by {product-title-short} observability, if it is enabled.

*Note:* If observability is enabled, you can enter a query for the metric from the Grafana _Explore_ page. 

When you create a policy, you are creating a _root_ policy. The framework watches for root policies, as well as `PlacementRules` and `PlacementBindings`, to determine where to create _propagated_ policies in order to distribute the policy to managed clusters.

For both root and propagated policies, a metric of `0` is recorded if the policy is compliant, and `1` if it is non-compliant.

The `policy_governance_info` metric uses the following labels:

- `type`: The label values are `root` or `propagated`.
- `policy`: The name of the associated root policy.
- `policy_namespace`: The namespace on the hub cluster where the root policy was defined.
- `cluster_namespace`: The namespace for the cluster where the policy is distributed.

These labels and values enable queries that can show us many things happening in the cluster that might be difficult to track.

*Note:* If the metrics are not needed, and there are any concerns about performance or security, this feature can be disabled. Set the `DISABLE_REPORT_METRICS` environment variable to `true` in the propagator deployment. You can also add `policy_governance_info` metric to the observability allowlist as a custom metric. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#adding-custom-metrics[Adding custom metrics] for more details.

[#metric-config-policies-evaluation-duration]
=== Metric: _config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds_

The `config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds` histogram tracks the number of seconds it takes to process all configuration policies that are ready to be evaluated on the cluster. Use the following metrics to query the histogram:

- `config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds_bucket`: The buckets are cumulative and represent seconds with the following possible entries: 1, 3, 9, 10.5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 300, 450, 600, and greater.
- `config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds_count`: The count of all events.
- `config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds_sum`: The sum of all values.

Use the `config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds` metric to determine if the `ConfigurationPolicy` `evaluationInterval` setting needs to be changed for resource intensive policies that do not need frequent evaluation. You can also increase the concurrency at the cost of higher resource utilization on the Kubernetes API server. See _Configure the concurrency_ section for more details. 

To receive information about the time used to evaluate configuration policies, perform a Prometheus query that resembles the following expression:

`rate(config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds_sum[10m])/rate (config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds_count[10m]`

The `config-policy-controller` pod running on managed clusters in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace calculates the metric. The `config-policy-controller` does not send the metric to observability by default.

[#verify-configuration-changes]
== Verify configuration changes

When the new configuration is applied by the controller, the `ManifestApplied` parameter is updated in the `ManagedClusterAddOn`. That condition timestamp can be used to verify the configuration correctly. For example, this command can verify when the `cert-policy-controller` on the `local-cluster` was updated:

----
oc get -n local-cluster managedclusteraddon cert-policy-controller | grep -B4 'type: ManifestApplied'
----

You might receive the following output:

----
 - lastTransitionTime: "2023-01-26T15:42:22Z"
    message: manifests of addon are applied successfully
    reason: AddonManifestApplied
    status: "True"
    type: ManifestApplied
