= Policy controllers

Policy controllers monitor and report whether your cluster is compliant with a policy. Use the {product-title} policy framework by using the out-of-the-box policy templates to apply predefined policy controllers and policies. The policy controllers are Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) instances.

For more information about CRDs, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[Extend the Kubernetes API with CustomResourceDefinitions]. Policy controllers remediate policy violations to make the cluster status compliant.

You can create custom policies and policy controllers with the product policy framework. See xref:../governance/create_policy_ctrl.adoc#creating-a-custom-policy-controller[Creating a custom policy controller] for more information.

**Important**: Only the configuration policy controller supports the `enforce` feature. You must manually remediate policies, where the policy controller does not support the `enforce` feature.
