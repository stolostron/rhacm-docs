[#image-vulnerability-policy]
= Image vulnerability policy

Apply the image vulnerability policy to detect if container images have vulnerabilities by leveraging the Container Security Operator. The policy installs the Container Security Operator on your managed cluster if it is not installed.

The image vulnerability policy is checked by the Kubernetes configuration policy controller.
For more information about the Security Operator, see the _Container Security Operator_ from the link:https://github.com/quay/container-security-operator[Quay repository].

*Notes:*

* Image vulnerability policy is not functional during a disconnected installation.

* The link:https://github.com/open-cluster-management/policy-collection/blob/main/stable/SI-System-and-Information-Integrity/policy-imagemanifestvuln.yaml[Image vulnerability policy] is not supported on the IBM Power and IBM Z architectures. It relies on the link:https://operatorhub.io/operator/project-quay-container-security-operator[Quay Container Security Operator]. There are no `ppc64le` or `s390x` images in the link:https://quay.io/repository/quay/container-security-operator[container-security-operator registry].

== Image vulnerability policy YAML structure

When you create the container security operator policy, it involves the following policies:

- A policy that creates the subscription (`container-security-operator`) to reference the name and channel. This configuration policy must have `spec.remediationAction` set to `enforce` to create the resources. The subscription pulls the profile, as a container, that the subscription supports. View the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-imagemanifestvuln-example-sub
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce  # will be overridden by remediationAction in parent policy
  severity: high
  object-templates:
    - complianceType: musthave
      objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
        kind: Subscription
        metadata:
          name: container-security-operator
          namespace: openshift-operators
        spec:
          # channel: quay-v3.3 # specify a specific channel if desired
          installPlanApproval: Automatic
          name: container-security-operator
          source: redhat-operators
          sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----

- An `inform` configuration policy to audit the `ClusterServiceVersion` to ensure that the container security operator installation succeeded. View the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-imagemanifestvuln-status
spec:
  remediationAction: inform  # will be overridden by remediationAction in parent policy
  severity: high
  object-templates:
    - complianceType: musthave
      objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
        kind: ClusterServiceVersion
        metadata:
          namespace: openshift-operators
        spec:
          displayName: Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator
        status:
          phase: Succeeded   # check the CSV status to determine if operator is running or not
----

- An `inform` configuration policy to audit whether any `ImageManifestVuln` objects were created by the image vulnerability scans. View the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-imagemanifestvuln-example-imv
spec:
  remediationAction: inform  # will be overridden by remediationAction in parent policy
  severity: high
  namespaceSelector:
    exclude: ["kube-*"]
    include: ["*"]
  object-templates:
    - complianceType: mustnothave # mustnothave any ImageManifestVuln object
      objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: secscan.quay.redhat.com/v1alpha1
        kind: ImageManifestVuln # checking for a Kind
