= Manage security policies

Use the _Governance_ dashboard to create, view, and manage your security policies and policy violations. You can create YAML files for your policies from the CLI and console. 

From the _Governance_ page, you can customize your Summary view by filtering the violations by categories or standards, collapse the summary to see less information, and you can search for policies. You can also filter the violation table view by policies or cluster violations.

The table of policies list the following details of a policy: _Policy name_, _Namespace_, _Remediation_, _Cluster violations_, _Controls_, _Automation_ and _Created_. You can edit, enable or disable, inform, or remove a policy by selecting the *Actions* icon. You can view the categories and standards of a specific policy by selecting the drop-down arrow to expand the row.

View the following descriptions of the frequency fields in the _Automation_ column:

- _Manual run_: Manually set this automation to run once. After the automation runs, it is set to `disabled`.
- _Run once mode_: When a policy is violated, the automation runs one time. After the automation runs, it is set to `disabled`. After the automation is set to `disabled`, you must continue to run the automation manually. When you run _once mode_, the extra variable of `target_clusters` is automatically supplied with the list of clusters that violated the policy. The Ansible Tower Job Template must have `PROMPT ON LAUNCH` enabled for the `EXTRA VARIABLES` section.
- _Disable automation_: When the scheduled automation is set to `disabled`, the automation does not run until the setting is updated. 

When you select a policy in the table list, the following tabs of information are displayed from the console:

- _Details_: Select the _Details_ tab to view policy details and placement details.
- _Status_: Select the _Status_ tab to view a table list of violations. You can filter your view by _Clusters_ or _Templates_. To view the compliance status of your policy, click the _View history_ link to view a list of violation messages from the _Status_ tab.
