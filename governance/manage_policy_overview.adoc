= Manage security policies

Use the _Governance_ dashboard to create, view, and manage your security policies and policy violations. You can create YAML files for your policies from the CLI and console. 

From the _Governance_ page, you can customize your _Summary_ view by filtering the violations by categories or standards, collapse the summary to see less information, and you can search for policies. You can also filter the violation table view by policies or cluster violations.

The table of policies lists the following details of a policy: _Policy name_, _Namespace_, _Status_, _Remediation_, _Cluster violations_, _Source_, _Controls_, _Automation_ and _Created_. You can edit, enable or disable, set remediation to inform or enforce, or remove a policy by selecting the *Actions* icon. You can view the categories and standards of a specific policy by selecting the drop-down arrow to expand the row.

View the following descriptions of the frequency fields in the _Automation_ column:

- _Manual run_: Manually set this automation to run once. After the automation runs, it is set to `disabled`.
- _Run once mode_: When a policy is violated, the automation runs one time. After the automation runs, it is set to `disabled`. After the automation is set to `disabled`, you must continue to run the automation manually. When you run _once mode_, the extra variable of `target_clusters` is automatically supplied with the list of clusters that violated the policy. The Ansible Tower Job Template must have `PROMPT ON LAUNCH` enabled for the `EXTRA VARIABLES` section.
- _Disable automation_: When the scheduled automation is set to `disabled`, the automation does not run until the setting is updated. 

When you select a policy in the table list, the following tabs of information are displayed from the console:

- _Details_: Select the _Details_ tab to view policy details and placement details. In the _Placement_ table, the _Compliance_ column provides links to view the compliance of the clusters that are displayed.
- _Clusters_: Select the _Clusters_ tab to view a table list of all clusters that are associated to the placement. Click the **View details** link to view the template details and YAML. You can also view related resources. Click the **View history** link to view the compliance status, violation message, and a time of the last report.
- _Templates_: Select the _Templates_ tab to view a table list of clusters that are associated to the placement for each template. You can view the compliance status, violation message, time of the last report, and view history for the template by selecting the _View history_ link.
