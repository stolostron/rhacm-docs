[#gov-metric]
= Governance metric

The policy framework exposes metrics that show policy distribution and compliance. Use the `policy_governance_info` metric on the hub cluster to view trends and analyze any policy failures.

[#metric-overview]
== Metric overview

When you create a policy, you are creating a _root_ policy. The framework watches for root policies as well as `PlacementRules` and `PlacementBindings`, to determine where to create _propagated_ policies in order to distribute the policy to managed clusters.
For both root and propagated policies, a metric of `0` is recorded if the policy is compliant, and `1` if it is non-compliant.

The `policy_governance_info` metric uses the following labels:

- `type`: The label values are `root` or `propagated`.
- `policy`: The name of the associated root policy.
- `policy_namespace`: The namespace on the hub cluster where the root policy was defined.
- `cluster_namespace`: The namespace for the cluster where the policy is distributed.

These labels and values enable queries that can show us many things happening in the cluster that might be difficult to track.

*Note*: If the metrics are not needed, and there are any concerns about performance or security, this feature can be disabled. Set the `DISABLE_REPORT_METRICS` environment variable to `true` in the propagator deployment. You can also add `policy_governance_info` metric to the observability allowlist as a custom metric. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#adding-custom-metrics[Adding custom metrics] for more details.
