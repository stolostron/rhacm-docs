[#pol-deploy-ext-tools]
= Policy deployment with external tools

To deploy `CertificatePolicy`, `ConfigurationPolicy`, `OperatorPolicy` resources, and Gatekeeper constraints directly to your managed cluster, you can use an external tool such as {gitops}.

[#pol-ext-tools-workflow]
== Deployment workflow

Your `CertificatePolicy`, `ConfigurationPolicy`, `OperatorPolicy` policies must be in the `open-cluster-management-policies` namespace or the managed cluster namespace. Policies in other namespaces are ignored and do not receive a status. If you are using a {gitops} version with an Argo CD version earlier than 2.13, you must configure {acm} policy health checks  

The {gitops-short} service account must have permission to manage {acm} policies. Deploy policies with {gitops-short} and view the policies from the _Discovered policies_ table of the Governance dashboard. The policies are grouped by the policy `name` and `kind` fields.
