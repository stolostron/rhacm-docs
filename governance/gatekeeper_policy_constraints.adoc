[#gatekeeper-policy]
== Integrating Gatekeeper constraints and constraint templates

Gatekeeper policies are written by using constraint templates (`ConstraintTemplates`) and constraints, both of which can be directly added to the `policy-templates` of a {product-title-short} `Policy`.

[#gatekeeper-policy-sample]
=== Gatekeeper policy sample

* `ConstraintTemplates` and constraints: Use the Gatekeeper integration feature by using {product-title-short} policies for multicluster distribution of Gatekeeper constraints and Gatekeeper audit results aggregation on the hub cluster. The following example defines a Gatekeeper `ConstraintTemplate` and constraint (`K8sRequiredLabels`) to ensure the `gatekeeper` label is set on all namespaces:

                  properties:
                    labels:

                  missing := required - provided

                  msg := sprintf("you must provide labels: %v", [missing])
                }
    - objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
        kind: K8sRequiredLabels
        metadata:
          name: ns-must-have-gk
          annotations:
            policy.open-cluster-management.io/severity: low <2>
        spec:
          enforcementAction: dryrun
          match:
            kinds:
              - apiGroups: [""]
                kinds: ["Namespace"]
          parameters:
            labels: ["gatekeeper"]
----

<1> Since the `remediationAction` is set to `inform`, the `enforcementAction` field of the Gatekeeper constraint is overridden to `warn`. This means that Gatekeeper detects and warns you about creating or updating a namespace that is missing the `gatekeeper` label. If the policy `remediationAction` is set to `enforce`, the Gatekeeper constraint `enforcementAction` field is overridden to `deny`. In this context, this configuration prevents any user from creating or updating a namespace that is missing the `gatekeeper` label.
+
<2> *Optional:* Set a severity value for the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/severity` annotation for each Gatekeeper constraint or constraint template. Valid values are the same as for other {product-title-short} policy types: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`.
+
With the previous policy, you might receive the following policy status message: `warn - you must provide labels: {"gatekeeper"} (on Namespace default); warn - you must provide labels: {"gatekeeper"} (on Namespace gatekeeper-system)`. Once a policy containing Gatekeeper constraints or `ConstraintTemplates` is deleted, the constraints and `ConstraintTemplates` are also deleted from the managed cluster.
+
To view the Gatekeeper audit results for a specific managed cluster from the console, navigate to the policy template _Results_ page. If search is enabled, view the YAML of the Kubernetes objects that failed the audit. 
+
*Notes:* 

- The Gatekeeper audit functionality runs every minute by default. Audit results are sent back to the hub cluster to be viewed in the {product-title-short} policy status of the managed cluster.

=== Policy to detect requests denied by Gatekeeper

* `policy-gatekeeper-admission`: Use the `policy-gatekeeper-admission` configuration policy within a {product-title-short} policy to check for Kubernetes API requests denied by the gatekeeper admission webhook:
