[#etcd-encryption-policy]
= ETCD encryption policy

Apply the `etcd-encryption` policy to detect, or enable encryption of sensitive data in the ETCD data-store.
Kubernetes configuration policy controller monitors the status of the `etcd-encryption` policy.
For more information, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/security/encrypting-etcd.html[Encrypting etcd data] in the {ocp-short} documentation. *Note*: The ETCD encryption policy only supports {ocp} 4 and later.

Learn more details about the `etcd-encryption` policy structure in the following sections:

[#etcd-encryption-policy-table]

.Parameter table
|===
| Field | Description

| apiVersion
| Required.
Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| kind
| Required.
Set the value to `Policy` to indicate the type of policy, for example, `ConfigurationPolicy`.

| metadata.name
| Required.
The name for identifying the policy resource.

| metadata.namespaces
| Optional.

| spec.namespace
| Required.
The namespaces within the hub cluster that the policy is applied to.
Enter parameter values for `include`, which are the namespaces you want to apply to the policy to.
The `exclude` parameter specifies the namespaces you explicitly do not want to apply the policy to.
*Note*: A namespace that is specified in the object template of a policy controller overrides the namespace in the corresponding parent policy.

| remediationAction
| Optional.
Specifies the remediation of your policy.
The parameter values are `enforce` and `inform`.
*Important*: Some policies might not support the enforce feature.

| disabled
| Required.
Set the value to `true` or `false`.
The `disabled` parameter provides the ability to enable and disable your policies.

| spec.complianceType
| Required.
Set the value to `"musthave"`

| spec.object-template
| Optional.
Used to list any other Kubernetes object that must be evaluated or applied to the managed clusters. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/security/encrypting-etcd.html[Encrypting etcd data] in the {ocp-short} documentation.
