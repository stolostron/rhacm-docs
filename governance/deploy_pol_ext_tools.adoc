[#deploy-pol-ext-tools]
= Deploying policies with external tools

To deploy `CertificatePolicy`, `ConfigurationPolicy`, `OperatorPolicy` resources, and Gatekeeper constraints directly to your managed cluster, use an external tool such as {gitops}.

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#pol-ext-tools-prereq]
== Prerequisites

* Your `CertificatePolicy`, `ConfigurationPolicy`, `OperatorPolicy` policies must be in the `open-cluster-management-policies` namespace or the managed cluster namespace. Policies in other namespaces are ignored and do not receive a status. 
* You must configure {acm} policy health checks if you are using a {gitops} version earlier than 2.13. You are not required to configure {acm} policy health checks for {gitops-short} version later than 2.13. See link:../gitops/gitops_manage_policy_def.adoc#config-gitops-healthcheck[Configuring policy health checks in {gitops-short}.
[#deploy-pol-gitops]
== Deploying policies with {giops-short} 

You can deploy policies with {gitops-short} and view the policies from the _Discovered policies_ table of the Governance dashboard. The policies are grouped by the policy `name` and `kind` parameters. 

//could we add steps for deploying the configuration policy example that you mention in the google doc?
