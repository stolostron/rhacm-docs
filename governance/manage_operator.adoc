= Managing operator policies in disconnected environments

You might need to deploy {product-title} policies on {ocp} clusters that are not connected to the internet (disconnected). If the policies you deploy are used to deploy policies that install an {olm} operator, you must follow the procedure for link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html-single/operators/index#olm-mirror-catalog_olm-restricted-networks[Mirroring an Operator catalog].

Complete the following steps to validate access to the operator images:

. See link:../install/install_disconnected.adoc#verify-required-package[Verify required packages are available] to validate that packages you require to use with policies are available. You must validate availability for each image registry used by any managed cluster that the following policies are deployed to: 
+
- `container-security-operator`
- **Deprecated:** `gatekeeper-operator-product`
- `compliance-operator`
+
. See link:../install/install_disconnected.adoc#disconnect-configure-icsp[Configure image content source policies] to validate that the sources are available. The image content source policies must exist on each of the disconnected managed clusters and can be deployed using a policy to simplify the process. See the following table of image source locations: 
+
|===
| Governance policy type | Image source location

| Container security
| `registry.redhat.io/quay`

| Compliance
| `registry.redhat.io/compliance`

| Gatekeeper
| `registry.redhat.io/rhacm2`
