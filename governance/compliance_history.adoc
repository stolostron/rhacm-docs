= Policy compliance history (Technology Preview)

The policy compliance history API is an opt-in technical preview feature to provide long-term storage of RHACM policy compliance events in a queryable format. It also provides additional details such as the policy’s point in time spec field for auditing and troubleshooting, and compliance events when a policy is disabled or removed from a cluster.

The policy compliance history API can also generate a comma-separated values (CSV) spreadsheet of policy compliance events for further auditing and troubleshooting.

[#prerequisites-compliance]
== Prerequisites

The policy compliance history API requires a PostgreSQL server on version 13 or newer. Some Red Hat supported options include using the registry.redhat.io/rhel9/postgresql-15 container image, the registry.redhat.io/rhel8/postgresql-13 container image, the postgresql-server RPM, or postgresql/server module. Please review the applicable official Red Hat documentation on setup and configuration for the path you choose. Note that the policy compliance history API is compatible with any standard PostgreSQL and is not limited to the official Red Hat supported offerings.

Note that this PostgreSQL server must be reachable from the RHACM hub. If the PostgreSQL server is running outside of the RHACM hub, ensure the routing and firewall configuration allows the RHACM hub to connect to port 5432 of the Postgresql server. This port may be a different value if it is overridden in the PostgreSQL configuration.

== Enable the compliance history API

Complete the following steps:

. Governance Policy Framework configuration
Once the policy compliance history API is up and running, the managed clusters need to be configured to record policy compliance events to the API. You may choose to enable this on all clusters or a subset of clusters.
Setting the policy compliance history API URL
To enable the feature on managed clusters, first retrieve the external URL of the policy compliance history API. You may retrieve this from the OpenShift Route object with the following command:

echo "https://$(oc -n open-cluster-management get route governance-history-api -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"

The output may look like the following but with your RHACM hub’s domain name instead of apps.openshift.redhat.com:

https://governance-history-api-open-cluster-management.apps.openshift.redhat.com
Next, create an AddOnDeploymentConfig object like the example below with replacing <replace with URL from previous command> with the actual value from the section. Note that this on its own does not configure the governance-policy-framework addon. It must be referenced as described in the “Enabled on all managed clusters” or “Enable on a single managed cluster” section.

apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: AddOnDeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: governance-policy-framework
  namespace: open-cluster-management
spec:
  customizedVariables:
    - name: complianceHistoryAPIURL
      value: <replace with URL from previous command>
Enable on all managed clusters
To enable this feature on all managed clusters, configure the governance-policy-framework ClusterManagementAddOn object to utilize the AddOnDeploymentConfig with the following command:

oc edit ClusterManagementAddOn governance-policy-framework
Then add or update the spec.supportedConfigs array to have an entry such as this:

  - group: addon.open-cluster-management.io
    resource: addondeploymentconfigs
    defaultConfig:
      name: governance-policy-framework
      namespace: open-cluster-management

Enable on a single managed cluster
To enable this feature on a single managed cluster instead of all managed clusters, configure the governance-policy-framework ManagedClusterAddOn in the managed cluster namespace on the RHACM hub with the following command but replacing <cluster namespace> with the managed cluster name you intend to enable the feature for:

oc -n <cluster namespace> edit ManagedClusterAddOn governance-policy-framework
Then add or update the spec.configs array to have an entry such as this:

- group: addon.open-cluster-management.io
  resource: addondeploymentconfigs
  name: governance-policy-framework
  namespace: open-cluster-management

. Validating the Governance Policy Framework configuration
To verify the configuration has taken effect, you may verify the governance-policy-framework Deployment on a managed cluster is updated accordingly with the --compliance-api-url container argument:

oc -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon get deployment governance-policy-framework -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[1].args}'
The output may look similar to the following:

["--enable-lease=true","--hub-cluster-configfile=/var/run/klusterlet/kubeconfig","--leader-elect=false","--log-encoder=console","--log-level=0","--v=-1","--evaluation-concurrency=2","--client-max-qps=30","--client-burst=45","--disable-spec-sync=true","--cluster-namespace=local-cluster","--compliance-api-url=https://governance-history-api-open-cluster-management.apps.openshift.redhat.com"]
At this point, any new compliance events will be recorded in the policy compliance history API.
Troubleshooting the Governance Policy Framework configuration
If policy compliance events are not being recorded for a particular managed cluster, you may look at the governance-policy-framework logs on the affected managed cluster:

oc -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon logs deployment/governance-policy-framework -f
You may see log messages such as this, indicating the issue. If the message value is empty in the log message, this usually indicates the policy compliance history API could not be reached. A likely cause is the policy compliance history API URL is not correct or there is a network communication issue.
