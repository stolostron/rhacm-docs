== Creating a configuration policy

You can create a YAML file for your configuration policy from the command line interface (CLI) or from the console.

If you have an existing Kubernetes manifest, consider using the Policy Generator to automatically include the manifests in a policy. See the xref:../governance/policy_generator.adoc#policy-generator[Policy Generator] documentation. View the following sections to create a configuration policy:

metadata:
  name: policy-1
  namespace: my-policies
policy-templates:
- apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
  kind: ConfigurationPolicy
