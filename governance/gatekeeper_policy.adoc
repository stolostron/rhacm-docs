[#gatekeeper-policy]
= Integrating gatekeeper constraints and constraint templates

Gatekeeper is a validating webhook that enforces custom resource definition (CRD) based policies that are run with the Open Policy Agent (OPA). You can install gatekeeper on your cluster by using the gatekeeper operator policy. Gatekeeper policy can be used to evaluate Kubernetes resource compliance. You can leverage a OPA as the policy engine, and use Rego as the policy language.

The gatekeeper policy is created as a Kubernetes configuration policy in {product-title-short}. Gatekeeper policies include constraint templates  (`ConstraintTemplates`) and `Constraints`, audit templates, and admission templates. For more information, see the https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper#gatekeeper[Gatekeeper upstream repository].

{product-title-short} supports version 3.3.0 for Gatekeeper and applies the following constraint templates in your {product-title-short} gatekeeper policy:

* `ConstraintTemplates` and constraints: Use the `policy-gatekeeper-k8srequiredlabels` policy to create a gatekeeper constraint template on the managed cluster.
