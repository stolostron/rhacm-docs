[#managing-security-policies]
= Managing security policies

Create a security policy to report and validate your cluster compliance based on your specified security standards, categories, and controls. To create a policy for {product-title}, you must create a YAML file on your managed clusters.

*Note*: You can copy and paste an existing policy in to the _Policy YAML_.
The values for the parameter fields are automatically entered when you paste your existing policy. You can also search the contents in your policy YAML file with the search feature.

[#creating-a-security-policy]
== Creating a security policy

You can create a security policy from the command line interface (CLI) or from the console.
Cluster administrator access is required.

*Important*: You must define a placement rule and placement binding to apply your policy to a specific cluster. Enter a valid value for the _Cluster selector_ field to define a `PlacementRule` and `PlacementBinding`. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#resources-that-support-set-based-requirements[Resources that support support set-based requirements] in the Kubernetes documentation for a valid expression. View the definitions of the objects that are required for your {product-title-short} policy:

* _PlacementRule_: Defines a _cluster selector_ where the policy must be deployed.
* _PlacementBinding_: Binds the placement to a placement rule.

View more descriptions of the policy YAML files in the xref:../governance/policy_example.adoc#policy-overview[Policy overview].

[#creating-a-security-policy-from-the-command-line-interface]
=== Creating a security policy from the command line interface

Complete the following steps to create a policy from the command line interface (CLI):

. Create a policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl create -f policy.yaml -n <namespace>
----

. Define the template that the policy uses.
Edit your `.yaml` file by adding a `templates` field to define a template.
Your policy might resemble the following YAML file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: policy1
spec:
  remediationAction: "enforce" # or inform
  disabled: false # or true
  namespaces:
    include: ["default"]
    exclude: ["kube*"]
  policy-templates:
    - objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
        kind: ConfigurationPolicy
        metadata:
          namespace: kube-system # will be inferred
          name: operator
        spec:
          remediationAction: "inform"
          object-templates:
            complianceType: "musthave" # at this level, it means the role must exist and must have the following rules
            apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
            kind: Role
            metadata:
              name: example
            objectDefinition:
              rules:
                - complianceType: "musthave" # at this level, it means if the role exists the rule is a musthave
                  apiGroups: ["extensions", "apps"]
                  resources: ["deployments"]
                  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "delete","patch"]
----

. Define a `PlacementRule`.
Be sure to change the `PlacementRule` to specify the clusters where the policies need to be applied, either by `clusterNames`, or `clusterLabels`.
View link:../manage_applications[Creating and managing placement rules].
Your `PlacementRule` might resemble the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementRule
metadata:
  name: placement1
spec:
  clusterConditions:
    - type: ManagedClusterConditionAvailable
      status: "True"
  clusterNames:
  - "cluster1"
  - "cluster2"
  clusterLabels:
    matchLabels:
      cloud: IBM
----

. Define a `PlacementBinding` to bind your policy and your `PlacementRule`.
Your `PlacementBinding` might resemble the following YAML sample:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementBinding
metadata:
  name: binding1
placementRef:
  name: placement1
  apiGroup: apps.open-cluster-management.io
  kind: PlacementRule
subjects:
- name: policy1
  apiGroup: policy.open-cluster-management.io
  kind: Policy
----

[#viewing-your-security-policy-from-the-cli]
==== Viewing your security policy from the CLI

Complete the following steps to view your security policy from the CLI:

. View details for a specific security policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get securityepolicy <policy-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
----

[#creating-a-cluster-security-policy-from-the-console]
=== Creating a cluster security policy from the console

As you create your new policy from the console, a YAML file is also created in the YAML editor.

. From the navigation menu, click *Governance*.
. To create a policy, click *Create policy*.
. Enter or select values for the following parameters:
 ** Name
 ** Namespace
 ** Specifications
 ** Cluster selector
 ** Standards
 ** Categories
 ** Controls
 ** Remediation action
 ** Disable policy

. View the following example {product-title} security policy definition.
Copy and paste the YAML file for your policy.

.. Delete a security policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl delete policy <securitypolicy-name> -n <open-cluster-management-namespace>
----
+
After your policy is deleted, it is removed from your target cluster or clusters. Verify that your policy is removed by running the following command: `kubectl get policy <securitypolicy-name> -n <open-cluster-management-namespace>`
