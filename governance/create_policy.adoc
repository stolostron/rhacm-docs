[#creating-a-security-policy]
== Creating a security policy

You can create a security policy from the command line interface (CLI) or from the console.

**Required access**: Cluster administrator

//PlacementRule here
*Important:* You must define a placement rule and placement binding to apply your policy to a specific cluster. Enter a valid value for the _Cluster selector_ field to define a `PlacementRule` and `PlacementBinding`. 

See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#resources-that-support-set-based-requirements[Resources that support support set-based requirements] in the Kubernetes documentation for a valid expression. View the definitions of the objects that are required for your {product-title-short} policy:
//PlacementRule here

* _PlacementRule_: Defines a _cluster selector_ where the policy must be deployed.
* _PlacementBinding_: Binds the placement to a placement rule.

[#creating-a-security-policy-from-the-command-line-interface]
=== Creating a security policy from the command line interface

Complete the following steps to create a policy from the command line interface (CLI):

. Create a policy by running the following command:
+
----
oc create -f policy.yaml -n <policy-namespace>
----

. Define the template that the policy uses. Edit your YAML file by adding a `policy-templates` field to define a template. Your policy might resemble the following YAML file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: policy1
spec:
  remediationAction: "enforce" # or inform
  disabled: false # or true
  namespaceSelector:
    include:
    - "default"
    - "my-namespace"
  policy-templates:
    - objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
        kind: ConfigurationPolicy
        metadata:
          name: operator
          # namespace: # will be supplied by the controller via the namespaceSelector
        spec:
          remediationAction: "inform"
          object-templates:
          - complianceType: "musthave" # at this level, it means the role must exist and must have the following rules
            apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
            kind: Role
            metadata:
              name: example
            objectDefinition:
              rules:
                - complianceType: "musthave" # at this level, it means if the role exists the rule is a musthave
                  apiGroups: ["extensions", "apps"]
                  resources: ["deployments"]
                  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "delete","patch"]
----
//PlacementRule used here, need to add a new step that shows how to define placement. We need to keep the PlacementRule step
. *Deprecated* Define a `PlacementRule`. Be sure to change the `PlacementRule` to specify the clusters where the policies need to be applied by adjusting the `clusterSelector`. View link:../applications/placement_sample.adoc#placement-rule-samples[Placement rule samples overview]
+
Your `PlacementRule` might resemble the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementRule
metadata:
  name: placement1
spec:
  clusterConditions:
    - type: ManagedClusterConditionAvailable
      status: "True"
  clusterNames:
  - "cluster1"
  - "cluster2"
- clusterSelector
    matchLabels:
      cloud: IBM
----

. Define a `PlacementBinding` to bind your policy to your `PlacementRule`. Your `PlacementBinding` might resemble the following YAML sample:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementBinding
metadata:
  name: binding1
placementRef:
  name: placement1
  apiGroup: apps.open-cluster-management.io
  kind: PlacementRule
subjects:
- name: policy1
  apiGroup: policy.open-cluster-management.io
  kind: Policy

[#cleaning-up-resources-from-policies]
== Cleaning up resources that are created by policies

Use the `pruneObjectBehavior` parameter in a configuration policy to clean up resources that are created by the policy. When `pruneObjectBehavior` is set, the related objects are only cleaned up after the configuration policy (or parent policy) associated with them is deleted. 

View the following descriptions of the values that can be used for the parameter:

* `DeleteIfCreated`: Cleans up any resources created by the policy.
* `DeleteAll`: Cleans up all resources managed by the policy.
* `None`: This is the default value and maintains the same behavior from previous releases, where no related resources are deleted.

You can set the value directly in the YAML file as you create a policy from the command line. 

From the console, you can select the value in the _Prune Object Behavior_ section of the the _Policy templates_ step.

*Notes:*

- If a policy that installs an operator has the `pruneObjectBehavior` parameter defined, then additional clean up is needed to complete the operator uninstall. You might need to delete the operator `ClusterServiceVersion` object as part of this cleanup.

- As you disable the `config-policy-addon` resource on the managed cluster, the `pruneObjbectBehavior` is ignored. To automatically clean up the related resources on the policies, you must remove the policies from the managed cluster before the add-on is disabled.
