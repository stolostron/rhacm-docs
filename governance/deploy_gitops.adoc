[#deploy-policies-using-gitops]
= Deploy policies using GitOps

You can deploy a set of policies across a fleet of managed clusters with the governance framework. You can add to the open source community, https://github.com/stolostron/policy-collection[`policy-collection`] by contributing to and using the policies in the repository. For more information, see https://github.com/stolostron/policy-collection/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-a-custom-policy[Contributing a custom policy]. Policies in each of the `stable` and `community` folders from the open source community are further organized according to link:https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4[NIST Special Publication 800-53]. 

Continue reading to learn best practices to use GitOps to automate and track policy updates and creation through a Git repository.

*Prerequisite:*: Before you begin, be sure to fork the `policy-collection` repository.

[#customizing-your-repo]
== Customizing your local repository

Customize your local repository by consolidating the `stable` and `community` policies into a single folder. Remove the policies you do not want to use. Complete the following steps to customize your local repository:

. Create a new directory in the repository to hold the policies that you want to deploy. Be sure that you are in your local `policy-collection` repository on your main default branch for GitOps. Run the following command:

+
----
mkdir my-policies
----

. Copy all of the `stable` and `community` policies into your `my-policies` directory. Start with the `community` policies first, in case the `stable` folder contains duplicates of what is available in the community. Run the following commands:

+
----
cp -R community/* my-policies/

cp -R stable/* my-policies/
----
+
Now that you have all of the policies in a single parent directory structure, you can edit the policies in your fork.
+
*Tips:*

* It is best practice to remove the policies you are not planning to use.

* Learn about policies and the definition of the policies from the following list:

** Purpose: Understand what the policy does.

** Remediation Action: Does the policy only inform you of compliance, or enforce the policy and make changes? See the `spec.remediationAction` parameter. If changes are enforced, make sure you understand the functional expectation. Remember to check which policies support enforcement. For more information, view the _Validate_ section.
+
*Note:* The `spec.remediationAction` set for the policy overrides any remediation action that is set in the individual `spec.policy-templates`.

** Placement: What clusters is the policy deployed to? By default, most policies target the clusters with the `environment: dev` label. Some policies may target {ocp-short} clusters or another label. You can update or add additional labels to include other clusters. When there is no specific value, the policy is applied to all of your clusters. You can also create multiple copies of a policy and customize each one if you want to use a policy that is configured one way for one set of clusters and configured another way for another set of clusters.

[#committing-to-your-repo]
== Committing to your local repository

After you are satisfied with the changes you have made to your directory, commit and push your changes to Git so that they can be accessed by your cluster. 

*Note:* This example is used to show the basics of how to use policies with GitOps, so you might have a different workflow to get changes to your branch.

Complete the following steps:

. From your terminal, run `git status` to view your recent changes in your directory that you previously created. Add your new directory to the list of changes to be committed with the following command:
+
----
git add my-policies/
----

. Commit the changes and customize your message. Run the following command:
+
----
git commit -m “Policies to deploy to the hub cluster”
----

. Push the changes to the branch of your forked repository that is used for GitOps. Run the following command:
+
----
git push origin <your_default_branch>master
----

Your changes are committed.

[#deploying-policies-to-your-cluster]
== Deploying policies to your cluster

After you push your changes, you can deploy the policies to your {product-title} installation. Post deployment, your hub cluster is connected to your Git repository. Any further changes to your chosen branch of the Git repository is reflected in your cluster.

*Note:* By default, policies deployed with GitOps use the `merge` reconcile option. If you want to use the `replace` reconcile option instead, add the `apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: replace` annotation to the `Subscription` resource. See link:../applications/subscribe_git_resources.adoc#resource-overwrite-example[Application Lifecycle] for more details.

The `deploy.sh` script creates `Channel` and `Subscription` resources in your hub cluster. The channel connects to the Git repository, and the subscription specifies the data to bring to the cluster through the channel. As a result, all policies defined in the specified subdirectory are created on your hub. After the policies are created by the subscription, {product-title-short} analyzes the policies and creates additional policy resources in the namespace associated with each managed cluster that the policy is applied to, based on the defined placement rule.

The policy is then copied to the managed cluster from its respective managed cluster namespace on the hub cluster. As a result, the policies in your Git repository are pushed to all managed clusters that have labels that match the `clusterSelector` that are defined in the placement rule of your policy.


Complete the following steps:

. From the `policy-collection` folder, run the following command to change the directory:
+
----
cd deploy
----

. Make sure that your command line interface (CLI) is configured to create resources on the correct cluster with the following command:
+
----
oc cluster-info
----
+
The output of the command displays the API server details for the cluster, where {product-title-short} is installed. If the correct URL is not displayed, configure your CLI to point to the correct cluster. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started#cli-using-cli_cli-developer-commands[Using the OpenShift CLI] for more information.

. Create a namespace where your policies are created to control access and to organize the policies. Run the following command:
+
----
oc create namespace policy-namespace
----

. Run the following command to deploy the policies to your cluster:
+
----
./deploy.sh -u https://github.com/<your-repository>/policy-collection -p my-policies -n policy-namespace
----
+
Replace `your-repository` with your Git user name or repository name.
+
*Note:* For reference, the full list of arguments for the `deploy.sh` script uses the following syntax:
+
----
./deploy.sh [-u <url>] [-b <branch>] [-p <path/to/dir>] [-n <namespace>] [-a|--name <resource-name>]
----
+
View the following explanations for each argument:

* URL: The URL to the repository that you forked from the main `policy-collection` repository. The default URL is `https://github.com/stolostron/policy-collection.git`.

* Branch: Branch of the Git repository to point to. The default branch is `main`.

* Subdirectory Path: The subdirectory path you created to contain the policies you want to use. In the previous sample, we used the `my-policies` subdirectory, but you can also specify which folder you want start with. For example, you can use `my-policies/AC-Access-Control`. The default folder is `stable`.

* Namespace: The namespace where the resources and policies are created on the hub cluster. These instructions use the `policy-namespace` namespace. The default namespace is `policies`.

* Name Prefix: Prefix for the `Channel` and `Subscription` resources. The default is `demo-stable-policies`.

After you run the `deploy.sh` script, any user with access to the repository can commit changes to the branch, which pushes changes to existing policies on your clusters.

*Note:* To deploy policies with subscriptions, complete the following steps:

. Bind the `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRole to the user creating the subscription.
. If you are using an allow list in the subscription, include the following API entries:

+
[source,yaml]
----
    - apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
      kinds:
        - "*"
    - apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
      kinds:
        - "*"
    - apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
      kinds:
        - PlacementRule
    - apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
      kinds:
        - Placement

[#verifying-gitops-policy-deployments-from-the-console]
== Verifying GitOps policy deployments from the console

Verify that your changes were applied to your policies from the console. You can also make more changes to your policy from the console, however the changes are reverted when the `Subscription` is reconciled with the Git repository. Complete the following steps:

. Log in to your {product-title-short} cluster.

. From the navigation menu, select *Governance*.

. Locate the policies that you deployed in the table. Policies that are deployed using GitOps have a _Git_ label in the _Source_ column. Click the label to view the details for the Git repository.

[#verifying-gitops-policy-deployments-from-the-cli]
=== Verifying GitOps policy deployments from the CLI

Complete the following steps:

. Check for the following policy details:
+
** Why is a specific policy compliant or non-compliant on the clusters that it was distributed to?
** Are the policies applied to the correct clusters?
** If this policy is not distributed to any clusters, why?
. Identify the GitOps deployed policies that you created or modified. The GitOps deployed policies can be identified by the annotation that is applied automatically. Annotations for the GitOps deployed policies resemble the following paths:
+
----
apps.open-cluster-management.io/hosting-deployable: policies/deploy-stable-policies-Policy-policy-role9

apps.open-cluster-management.io/hosting-subscription: policies/demo-policies

apps.open-cluster-management.io/sync-source: subgbk8s-policies/demo-policies
----
+
GitOps annotations are valuable to see which subscription created the policy. You can also add your own labels to your policies so that you can write runtime queries that select policies based on labels.
+
For example, you can add a label to a policy with the following command:
+
----
oc label policy <policy-name> -n <policy-namespace> <key>=<value>
----
+
Then, you can query policies that have labels with the following command:
+
----
oc get policy -n <policy-namespace> -l <key>=<value>
----

Your policies are deployed using GitOps.
