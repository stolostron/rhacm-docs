[#support-templates-in-config-policies]
= Support for templates in configuration policies

Configuration policies support the inclusion of Golang text templates in the object definitions. These templates are resolved at runtime either on the hub cluster or the target managed cluster using configurations related to that cluster. This gives you the ability to define configuration policies with dynamic content, and inform or enforce Kubernetes resources that are customized to the target cluster.

[#prerequisites-templatized]
== Prerequisite

* The template syntax must be conformed to the Golang template language specification, and the resource definition generated from the resolved template must be a valid YAML. See the Golang documentation about https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[Package templates] for more information. Any errors in template validation are recognized as policy violations. When you use a custom template function, the values are replaced at runtime.

[#template-functions]
== Template functions

Template functions, such as resource-specific and generic `lookup` template functions, are available for referencing Kubernetes resources on the hub cluster (using the `{{hub ... hub}}` delimiters), or managed cluster (using the `{{ ... }}` delimiters). See <<hub-templates,Support for hub cluster templates in configuration policies>> for more details. The resource-specific functions are used for convenience and makes content of the resources more accessible. If you use the generic function, `lookup`, which is more advanced, it is best to be familiar with the YAML structure of the resource that is being looked up. In addition to these functions, utility functions like `base64encode`, `base64decode`, `indent`, `autoindent`, `toInt`, `toBool`, and more are also available.

To conform templates with YAML syntax, templates must be set in the policy resource as strings using quotes or a block character (`|` or `>`). This causes the resolved template value to also be a string. To override this, consider using `toInt` or `toBool` as the final function in the template to initiate further processing that forces the value to be interpreted as an integer or boolean respectively.

[#fromsecret-func]
=== fromSecret function

The `fromSecret` function returns the value of the given data key in the secret. View the following syntax for the function:

----
func fromSecret (ns string, secretName string, datakey string) (dataValue string, err error)
----

When you use this function, enter the namespace, name, and data key of a Kubernetes `Secret` resource. You must use the same namespace that is used for the policy when using the function in a hub cluster template. See, <<hub-templates,Support for hub cluster templates in configuration policies>> for more details.

**Note:** When you use this function with hub cluster templates, the output is automatically encrypted using the the <<protect-function,protect function>>. 

You receive a policy violation if the Kubernetes `Secret` resource does not exist on the target cluster. If the data key does not exist on the target cluster, the value becomes an empty string. View the following configuration policy that enforces a `Secret` resource on the target cluster. The value for the `PASSWORD` data key is a template that references the secret on the target cluster:

[#fromConfigmap-func]
=== fromConfigmap function

The `fromConfigmap` function returns the value of the given data key in the ConfigMap. View the following syntax for the function:

----
func fromConfigMap (ns string, configmapName string, datakey string) (dataValue string, err Error)
----

When you use this function, enter the namespace, name, and data key of a Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resource. You must use the same namespace that is used for the policy using the function in a hub cluster template. See, <<hub-templates,Support for hub cluster templates in configuration policies>> for more details. You receive a policy violation if the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resource does not exist on the target cluster. If the data key does not exist on the target cluster, the value becomes an empty string. View the following configuration policy that enforces a Kubernetes resource on the target managed cluster. The value for the `log-file` data key is a template that retrieves the value of the `log-file` from the ConfigMap, `logs-config` from the `default` namespace, and the `log-level` is set to the data key `log-level`.

[#fromclusterclaim-func]
=== fromClusterClaim function

The `fromClusterClaim` function returns the value of the `Spec.Value` in the `ClusterClaim` resource. View the following syntax for the function:

----
func fromClusterClaim (clusterclaimName string) (value map[string]interface{}, err Error)
----

When you use this function, enter the name of a Kubernetes `ClusterClaim` resource. You receive a policy violation if the `ClusterClaim` resource does not exist. View the following example of the configuration policy that enforces a Kubernetes resource on the target managed cluster. The value for the `platform` data key is a template that retrieves the value of the `platform.open-cluster-management.io` cluster claim. Similarly, it retrieves values for `product` and `version` from the `ClusterClaim`:

[#lookup-func]
=== lookup function

The `lookup` function returns the Kubernetes resource as a JSON compatible map. If the requested resource does not exist, an empty map is returned. If the resource does not exist and the value is provided to another template function, you might get the following error: `invalid value; expected string`.

*Best practice:* Use the `default` template function, so the correct type is provided to later template functions.

View the following syntax for the function:

----
func lookup (apiversion string, kind string, namespace string, name string) (value string, err Error)
----

When you use this function, enter the API version, kind, namespace, and name of the Kubernetes resource. You must use the same namespace that is used for the policy within the hub cluster template. See, <<hub-templates,Support for hub cluster templates in configuration policies>> for more details. View the following example of the configuration policy that enforces a Kubernetes resource on the target managed cluster. The value for the `metrics-url` data key is a template that retrieves the `v1/Service` Kubernetes resource `metrics` from the `default` namespace, and is set to the value of the `Spec.ClusterIP` in the queried resource:

[#base64enc-func]
=== base64enc function

The `base64enc` function returns a `base64` encoded value of the input `data string`. View the following syntax for the function:

----
func base64enc (data string) (enc-data string)
----

When you use this function, enter a string value. View the following example of the configuration policy that uses the `base64enc` function:

[#indent-function]
=== indent function

The `indent` function returns the padded `data string`. View the following syntax for the function:

----
func indent (spaces  int,  data string) (padded-data string)
----

When you use this function, enter a data string with the specific number of spaces. View the following example of the configuration policy that uses the `indent` function:

----

[#autoindent-function]
=== autoindent function

The `autoindent` function acts like the `indent` function that automatically determines the number of leading spaces based on the number of spaces before the template. View the following example of the configuration policy that uses the `autoindent` function:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1

        {{ ( index ( lookup "v1" "Secret" "default" "mycert-tls"  ).data  "ca.pem"  ) |  base64dec | autoindent }}
----

[#toInt-function]
=== toInt function

The `toInt` function casts and returns the integer value of the input value. Also, when this is the last function in the template, there is further processing of the source content. This is to ensure that the value is interpreted as an integer by the YAML. View the following syntax for the function:

----
func toInt (input interface{}) (output int)
----

When you use this function, enter the data that needs to be casted as an integer. View the following example of the configuration policy that uses the `toInt` function:


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: demo-template-function

    objectDefinition:
    ...
    spec:
      vlanid:  |
        {{ (fromConfigMap "site-config" "site1" "vlan")  | toInt }}
----

[#toBool-function]
=== toBool function

The `toBool` function converts the input string into a boolean, and returns the boolean. Also, when this is the last function in the template, there is further processing of the source content. This is to ensure that the value is interpreted as a boolean by the YAML. View the following syntax for the function:

----
func toBool (input string) (output bool)
----

When you use this function, enter the string data that needs to be converted to a boolean. View the following example of the configuration policy that uses the `toBool` function:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1

  object-templates:
  - complianceType: musthave
    objectDefinition:
    ...
    spec:
      enabled:  |
        {{ (fromConfigMap "site-config" "site1" "enabled")  | toBool }}
----

[#protect-function]
=== protect function

The `protect` function enables you to encrypt a string in a hub cluster policy template. It is automatically decrypted on the managed cluster when the policy is evaluated. View the following example of the configuration policy that uses the `protect` function:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: demo-template-function
  namespace: test
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    exclude:
    - kube-*
    include:
    - default
  object-templates:
  - complianceType: musthave
    objectDefinition:
    ...
    spec:
      enabled:  |
        {{hub "(lookup "v1" "Secret" "default" "my-hub-secret").data.message | protect hub}}
----

In the previous YAML example, there is an existing hub cluster policy template that is defined to use the `lookup` function. On the replicated policy in the managed cluster namespace, the value might resemble the following syntax: `$ocm_encrypted:okrrBqt72oI+3WT/0vxeI3vGa+wpLD7Z0ZxFMLvL204=`

Each encryption algorithm used is AES-CBC using 256-bit keys. Each encryption key is unique per managed cluster and is automatically rotated every 30 days.

This ensures that your decrypted value is to never be stored in the policy on the managed cluster.

To force an immediate rotation, delete the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/last-rotated` annotation on the `policy-encryption-key` Secret in the managed cluster namespace on the hub cluster. Policies are then reprocessed to use the new encryption key.

[#hub-templates]
== Support for hub cluster templates in configuration policies

In addition to managed cluster templates that are dynamically customized to the target cluster, {product-title-short} also supports hub cluster templates to define configuration policies using values from the hub cluster. This combination reduces the need to create separate policies for each target cluster or hardcode configuration values in the policy definitions. 

Hub cluster templates are based on Golang text template specifications, and the `{{hub … hub}}` delimiter indicates a hub cluster template in a configuration policy.

For security, both resource-specific and the generic lookup functions in hub cluster templates are restricted to the namespace of the policy on the hub cluster. View the <<template-comparison-table,Comparison of hub and managed cluster templates>> for additional details.

*Important:* If you use hub cluster templates to propagate secrets or other sensitive data, the sensitive data exists in the managed cluster namespace on the hub cluster and on the managed clusters where that policy is distributed. The template content is expanded in the policy, and policies are not encrypted by the {ocp-short} ETCD encryption support. To address this, use `fromSecret`, which automatically encrypts the values from the Secret, or `protect` to encrypt other values.

[#template-processing]
=== Template processing

A configuration policy definition can contain both hub cluster and managed cluster templates. Hub cluster templates are processed first on the hub cluster, then the policy definition with resolved hub cluster templates is propagated to the target clusters. On the managed cluster, the `ConfigurationPolicyController` processes any managed cluster templates in the policy definition and then enforces or verifies the fully resolved object definition.

[#special-annotation-processing]
=== Special annotation for reprocessing

Policies are processed on the hub cluster only upon creation or after an update. Therefore, hub cluster templates are only resolved to the data in the referenced resources upon policy creation or update. Any changes to the referenced resources are not automatically synced to the policies. 

A special annotation, `policy.open-cluster-management.io/trigger-update` can be used to indicate changes to the data referenced by the templates. Any change to the special annotation value initiates template processing, and the latest contents of the referenced resource are read and updated in the policy definition that is the propagator for processing on managed clusters. A typical way to use this annotation is to increment the value by one each time.

[#bypass-template-processing]
=== Bypass template processing

You might create a policy that contains a template that is not intended to be processed by {product-title-short}. By default, {product-title-short} processes all templates. 

To bypass template processing for your hub cluster, you must change `{{ template content }}` to `{{ `{{ template content }}`` `}}`.

Alternatively, you can add the following annotation in the `ConfigurationPolicy` section of your `Policy`: `policy.open-cluster-management.io/disable-templates: "true"`. When this annotation is included, the previous workaround is not necessary. Template processing is bypassed for the `ConfigurationPolicy`.

See the following table for a comparison of hub cluster and managed cluster templates:

[#template-comparison-table]
=== Comparison of hub cluster and managed cluster templates

.Comparison table
|===
| Templates | Hub cluster | Managed cluster 

| Syntax
| Golang text template specification
| Golang text template specification

| Delimiter
| {{hub … hub}}
| {{ … }}

| Context
| A `.ManagedClusterName` variable is available, which at runtime, resolves to the name of the target cluster where the policy is propagated.
| No context variables

| Access control
| You can only reference namespaced Kubernetes objects that are in the same namespace as the `Policy` resource.
| You can reference any resource on the cluster.

| Functions
| A set of template functions that support dynamic access to Kubernetes resources and string manipulation. See <<template-functions,Template functions>> for more information. See the Access control row for lookup restrictions.

The `fromSecret` template function on the hub cluster stores the resulting value as an encrypted string on the replicated policy, in the managed cluster namespace. 

The equivalent call might use the following syntax: `{{hub "(lookup "v1" "Secret" "default" "my-hub-secret").data.message \| protect hub}}`
| A set of template functions support dynamic access to Kubernetes resources and string manipulation. See <<template-functions,Template functions>> for more information.

| Function output storage
| The output of template functions are stored in `Policy` resource objects in each applicable managed cluster namespace on the hub cluster, before it is synced to the managed cluster. This means that any sensitive results from template functions are readable by anyone with read access to the `Policy` resource objects on the hub cluster, and read access with `ConfigurationPolicy` resource objects on the managed clusters. Additionally, if link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/security/encrypting-etcd.html[etcd encryption] is enabled, the `Policy` and `ConfigurationPolicy` resource objects are not encrypted. It is best to carefully consider this when using template functions that return sensitive output (e.g. from a secret).
| The output of template functions are not stored in policy related resource objects.

| Processing
| Processing occurs at runtime on the hub cluster during propagation of replicated policies to clusters. Policies and the hub cluster templates within the policies are processed on the hub cluster only when templates are created or updated.
| Processing occurs in the `ConfigurationPolicyController` on the managed cluster. Policies are processed periodically, which automatically updates the resolved object definition with data in the referenced resources.

| Processing errors
| Errors from the hub cluster templates are displayed as violations on the managed clusters the policy applies to.
| Errors from the managed cluster templates are displayed as violations on the specific target cluster where the violation occurred.
