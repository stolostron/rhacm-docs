= Certificates

All certificates required by services that run on {product-title-short} are created during the installation of {product-title-short}. View the following list of certificates, which are created and managed by the following components of {ocp}:

* OpenShift Service Serving Certificates
* {product-title-short} webhook controllers
* Kubernetes Certificates API
* OpenShift default ingress

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

[#acm-certs]
== {product-title-short} hub cluster certificates

OpenShift default ingress certificate is technically a hub cluster certificate. After the {product-title-short} installation, observability certificates are created and used by the observability components to provide mutual TLS on the traffic between the hub cluster and managed cluster.

* The `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace contains the following certificates:

- `observability-server-ca-certs`: Has the CA certificate to sign server-side certificates
- `observability-client-ca-certs`: Has the CA certificate to sign client-side certificates
- `observability-server-certs`: Has the server certificate used by the `observability-observatorium-api` deployment
- `observability-grafana-certs`: Has the client certificate used by the `observability-rbac-query-proxy` deployment 

* The `open-cluster-management-addon-observability` namespace contain the following certificates on managed clusters:

- `observability-managed-cluster-certs`: Has the same server CA certificate as `observability-server-ca-certs` in the hub server
- `observability-controller-open-cluster-management.io-observability-signer-client-cert`: Has the client certificate used by the `metrics-collector-deployment` 

The CA certificates are valid for five years and other certificates are valid for one year. All observability certificates are automatically refreshed upon expiration. View the following list to understand the effects when certificates are automatically renewed:

* Non-CA certificates are renewed automatically when the remaining valid time is no more than 73 days. After the certificate is renewed, the pods in the related deployments restart automatically to use the renewed certificates.

* CA certificates are renewed automatically when the remaining valid time is no more than one year. After the certificate is renewed, the old CA is not deleted but co-exist with the renewed ones. Both old and renewed certificates are used by related deployments, and continue to work. The old CA certificates are deleted when they expire.

* When a certificate is renewed, the traffic between the hub cluster and managed cluster is not interrupted.

[#managed-cluster-certificates]
=== Managed cluster certificates

You can use certificates to authenticate managed clusters with the hub cluster. Therefore, it is important to be aware of troubleshooting scenarios associated with these certificates.

The managed cluster certificates are refreshed automatically.
