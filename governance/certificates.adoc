[#certificates]
= Certificates

All certificates required by services that run on {product-title-short} are created during the installation of {product-title-short}. Certificates are created and managed by the following components of the OpenShift platform:

* OpenShift Service Serving Certificates
* {product-title-short} webhook controllers
* Kubernetes Certificates API
* OpenShift default ingress

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

== {product-title-short} hub cluster certificates

OpenShift default ingress certificate is considered a hub cluster certificate. After {product-title-short} is installed, observability certificates are created and used by the observability components to provide mutual TLS on the traffic between the hub cluster and managed cluster. The Kubernetes secrets that are associated with the observability certificates. 

* The `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace contains the following certificates:

- `observability-server-ca-certs`: Has the CA certificate to sign server-side certificates
- `observability-client-ca-certs`: Has the CA certificate to sign client-side certificates
- `observability-server-certs`: Has the server certificate used by the `observability-observatorium-api` deployment
- `observability-grafana-certs`: Has the client certificate used by the `observability-rbac-query-proxy` deployment 

* The `open-cluster-management-addon-observability` namespace contain the following certificates on managed clusters:

- `observability-managed-cluster-certs`: Has the same server CA certificate as `observability-server-ca-certs` in the hub server
- `observability-controller-open-cluster-management.io-observability-signer-client-cert`: Has the client certificate used by the `metrics-collector-deployment` 

The CA certificates are valid for five years and other certificates are valid for one year. All observability certificates are automatically refreshed upon expiration. View the following list to understand the effects when certificates are automatically renewed:

* Non-CA certificates are renewed automatically when the remaining valid time is no more than 73 days. After the certificate is renewed, the pods in the related deployments restart automatically to use the renewed certificates.

* CA certificates are renewed automatically when the remaining valid time is no more than one year. After the certificate is renewed, the old CA is not deleted but co-exist with the renewed ones. Both old and renewed certificates are used by related deployments, and continue to work. The old CA certificates are deleted when they expire.

* When a certificate is renewed, the traffic between the hub cluster and managed cluster is not interrupted.

[#managed-cluster-certificates]
=== Managed cluster certificates

Certificates are used to authenticate managed clusters with the hub cluster. Therefore, it is important to be aware of troubleshooting scenarios associated with these certificates. For more details select the link to the _Troubleshooting imported clusters offline after certificate change_ topic in the _Additional resources_ section. 

The managed cluster certificates are refreshed automatically.

- Use the certificate policy controller to create and manage certificate policies on managed clusters. See xref:../governance/cert_policy_ctrl.adoc#certificate-policy-controller[Certificate policy controller] for more details.
