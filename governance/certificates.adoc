[#certificates]
= Certificates

Various certificates are created and used throughout {product-title}.

You can bring your own certificates. You must create a Kubernetes TLS Secret for your certificate. After you create your certificates, you can replace certain certificates that are created by the {product-title-short} installer.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

All certificates required by services that run on {product-title-short} are created during the installation of {product-title-short}. Certificates are created and managed by the following components:

* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/security_and_compliance/configuring-certificates#add-service-serving[OpenShift Service Serving Certificates]
* {product-title-short} webhook controllers
* Kubernetes Certificates API

[#observability-certificates]
=== Observability certificates

After {product-title-short} is installed, observability certificates are created and used by the observability components, to provide mutual TLS on the traffic between the hub cluster and managed cluster. The Kubernetes secrets that are associated with the observability certificates. 

The `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace contain the following certificates:

* `observability-server-ca-certs`: Has the CA certificate to sign server-side certificates
* `observability-client-ca-certs`: Has the CA certificate to sign client-side certificates
* `observability-server-certs`: Has the server certificate used by the `observability-observatorium-api` deployment
* `observability-grafana-certs`: Has the client certificate used by the `observability-rbac-query-proxy` deployment 


The `open-cluster-management-addon-observability` namespace contain the following certificates on managed clusters:

* `observability-managed-cluster-certs`: Has the same server CA certificate as `observability-server-ca-certs` in the hub server
* `observability-controller-open-cluster-management.io-observability-signer-client-cert`: Has the client certificate used by the `metrics-collector-deployment` 


The CA certificates are valid for five years and other certificates are valid for one year. All observability certificates are automatically refreshed upon expiration.

View the following list to understand the effects when certificates are automatically renewed:

* Non-CA certificates are renewed automatically when the remaining valid time is no more than 73 days. After the certificate is renewed, the pods in the related deployments restart automatically to use the renewed certificates.

* CA certificates are renewed automatically when the remaining valid time is no more than one year. After the certificate is renewed, the old CA is not deleted but co-exist with the renewed ones. Both old and renewed certificates are used by related deployments, and continue to work. The old CA certificates are deleted when they expire.

* When a certificate is renewed, the traffic between the hub cluster and managed cluster is not interrupted.

[#observability-byo-certificates]
=== Bring Your Own (BYO) observability certificate authority (CA) certificates

If you do not want to use the default observability CA certificates generated by {product-title-short}, you can choose to use the BYO observability CA certificates before you enable observability.

[#openssl-commands-ca]
==== OpenSSL commands to generate CA certificate

Observability requires two CA certificates; one is for the server-side and the other is for the client-side.

* Generate your CA RSA private keys with the following commands:
+
----
openssl genrsa -out serverCAKey.pem 2048

openssl genrsa -out clientCAKey.pem 2048
----

* Generate the self-signed CA certificates using the private keys. Run the following commands:
+
----
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -nodes -key serverCAKey.pem -days 1825 -out serverCACert.pem

openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -nodes -key clientCAKey.pem -days 1825 -out clientCACert.pem
----

[#create-secrets-byo-certs]
==== Create the secrets associated with the BYO observability CA certificates

Complete the following steps to create the secrets:

. Create the `observability-server-ca-certs` secret by using your certificate and private key. Run the following command:
+
----
oc -n open-cluster-management-observability create secret tls observability-server-ca-certs --cert ./serverCACert.pem --key ./serverCAKey.pem
----

. Create the `observability-client-ca-certs` secret by using your certificate and private key. Run the following command:
+
----
oc -n open-cluster-management-observability create secret tls observability-client-ca-certs --cert ./clientCACert.pem --key ./clientCAKey.pem
----

[#replacing-cert-alertmanager]
==== Replacing certificates for alertmanager route

You can replace alertmanager certificates by updating the alertmanager route, if you do not want to use the OpenShift default ingress certificate. Complete the following steps:

. Examine the observability certificate with the following command:
+
----
openssl x509  -noout -text -in ./observability.crt
----

. Change the common name (`CN`) on the certificate to `alertmanager`.

. Change the SAN in the `csr.cnf` configuration file with the hostname for your alertmanager route.

. Create the two following secrets in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace. Run the following command:
+
----
oc -n open-cluster-management-observability create secret tls alertmanager-byo-ca --cert ./ca.crt --key ./ca.key

oc -n open-cluster-management-observability create secret tls alertmanager-byo-cert --cert ./ingress.crt --key ./ingress.key
----

For more information, see xref:../governance/cert_mgmt_ingress.adoc#openssl-commands-for-generating-a-certificate[OpenSSL commands for generating a certificate]. If you want to restore the default self-signed certificate for alertmanager route, see xref:../governance/cert_mgmt_ingress.adoc#restore-the-default-self-signed-certificate-for-management-ingress[Restore the default self-signed certificate for management ingress] to delete the two secrets in the `open-cluster-management-observability` namespace.

[#list-hub-cluster-managed-certificates]
=== List hub cluster managed certificates

You can view a list of hub cluster managed certificates that use https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/security/certificates/service-serving-certificate.html[OpenShift Service Serving Certificates] service internally. Run the following command to list the certificates: 

----
for ns in multicluster-engine open-cluster-management ; do echo "$ns:" ; oc get secret -n $ns -o custom-columns=Name:.metadata.name,Expiration:.metadata.annotations.service\\.beta\\.openshift\\.io/expiry | grep -v '<none>' ; echo ""; done
----

*Note:* If observability is enabled, there are additional namespaces where certificates are created.

[#refresh-hub-cluster-managed-certificates]
=== Refresh hub cluster managed certificates 

You can refresh a hub cluster managed certificate by running the `delete secret` command in the <<list-hub-cluster-managed-certificates,List hub cluster managed certificates>> section. When you identify the certificate that you need to refresh, delete the secret that is associated with the certificate. For example, you can delete a secret by running the following command:

----
oc delete secret grc-0c925-grc-secrets -n open-cluster-management
----

*Note:* After you delete the secret, a new one is created. However, you must restart pods that use the secret manually so they can begin to use the new certificate.

[#refresh-an-acm-webhook]
=== Refresh a {product-title-short} webhook certificate

You can refresh {ocp-short} managed certificates, which are certificates that are used by {product-title-short} webhooks. 

Complete the following steps to refresh {product-title-short} webhook certificate:

. Delete the secret that is associated with the {ocp-short} managed certificate by running the following command:
+
----
oc delete secret -n open-cluster-management ocm-webhook-secret
----
+
*Note:* Some services might not have a secret that needs to be deleted.

. Restart the services that are associated with the {ocp-short} managed certificate(s) by running the following command:
+
----
oc delete po -n open-cluster-management ocm-webhook-679444669c-5cg76
----
+
*Important:* There are replicas of many services; each service must be restarted.

View the following table for a summarized list of the pods that contain certificates and whether a secret needs to be deleted prior to restarting the pod:

[#channel-certificates]
=== Channel certificates

CA certificates can be associated with Git channel that are a part of the {product-title-short} application management. See link:../applications/configuring_git_channel.adoc#using-custom-CA-certificates-for-secure-HTTPS-connection[Using custom CA certificates for a secure HTTPS connection] for more details.

Helm channels allow you to disable certificate validation. Helm channels where certificate validation is disabled, must be configured in development environments. Disabling certificate validation introduces security risks.

[#managed-cluster-certificates]
=== Managed cluster certificates

Certificates are used to authenticate managed clusters with the hub. Therefore, it is important to be aware of troubleshooting scenarios associated with these certificates. View link:../troubleshooting/trouble_cluster_offline_cert.adoc#troubleshooting-imported-clusters-offline-after-certificate-change[Troubleshooting imported clusters offline after certificate change] for more details.  

The managed cluster certificates are refreshed automatically.

[#rotating-the-gatekeeper-webhook-certificate]
=== Rotating the gatekeeper webhook certificate

Complete the following steps to rotate the gatekeeper webhook certificate:

. Edit the secret that contains the certificate with the following command: 
+
----
oc edit secret -n openshift-gatekeeper-system gatekeeper-webhook-server-cert
----

. Delete the following content in the `data` section: `ca.crt`, `ca.key`, tls.crt`, and `tls.key`.

. Restart the gatekeeper webhook service by deleting the `gatekeeper-controller-manager` pods with the following command:
+
----
oc delete po -n openshift-gatekeeper-system -l control-plane=controller-manager
----

The gatekeeper webhook certificate is rotated. 

[#rotating-the-integrity-shield-webhook-certificate]
=== Rotating the integrity shield webhook certificate (Technology Preview)

Complete the following steps to rotate the integrity shield webhook certificate:

. Edit the IntegrityShield custom resource and add the `integrity-shield-operator-system` namespace to the excluded list of namespaces in the `inScopeNamespaceSelector` setting. Run the following command to edit the resource:
+
----
oc edit integrityshield integrity-shield-server -n integrity-shield-operator-system
----

. Delete the secret that contains the integrity shield certificate by running the following command:
+
----
oc delete secret -n integrity-shield-operator-system ishield-server-tls
----

. Delete the operator so that the secret is recreated. Be sure that the operator pod name matches the pod name on your system. Run the following command:
+
----
oc delete po -n integrity-shield-operator-system integrity-shield-operator-controller-manager-64549569f8-v4pz6
----

. Delete the integrity shield server pod to begin using the new certificate with the following command:
+
----
oc delete po -n integrity-shield-operator-system integrity-shield-server-5fbdfbbbd4-bbfbz
----
