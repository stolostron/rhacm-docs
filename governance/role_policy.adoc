[#role-policy]
= Role policy

Kubernetes configuration policy controller monitors the status of role policies.
Define roles in the `object-template` to set rules and permissions for specific roles in your cluster.

Learn more details about the role policy structure in the following sections:

[#role-policy-sample]
== Role policy sample

Apply a role policy to set rules and permissions for specific roles in your cluster.
For more information on roles, see link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control]. View a sample of a role policy, see https://github.com/open-cluster-management/policy-collection/blob/master/stable/AC-Access-Control/policy-role.yaml[`policy-role.yaml`].

To learn how to manage role policies, refer to xref:../governance/create_role_policy.adoc#managing-role-policies[Managing role policies] for more information. See the xref:../governance/config_policy_ctrl.adoc#kubernetes-configuration-policy-controller[Kubernetes configuration policy controller] to view other configuration policies that are monitored the controller.
