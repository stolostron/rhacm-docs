[#certificates-byo]
= Bringing your own observability Certificate Authority (CA) certificates

When you install {product-title}, only Certificate Authority (CA) certificates for observability are provided by default. If you do not want to use the default observability CA certificates generated by {product-title-short}, you can choose to bring your own observability CA certificates before you enable observability.

[#openssl-commands-ca]
== Generating CA certificates by using OpenSSL commands

Observability requires two CA certificates, one for the server-side and the other is for the client-side.

* Generate your CA RSA private keys with the following commands:
+
----
openssl genrsa -out serverCAKey.pem 2048
openssl genrsa -out clientCAKey.pem 2048
----

* Generate the self-signed CA certificates using the private keys. Run the following commands:
+
----
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -nodes -key serverCAKey.pem -days 1825 -out serverCACert.pem
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -nodes -key clientCAKey.pem -days 1825 -out clientCACert.pem

[#create-secrets-byo-certs]
== Creating the secrets associated with the BYO observability CA certificates

Complete the following steps to create the secrets:

. Create the `observability-server-ca-certs` secret by using your certificate and private key. Run the following command:
+
----
oc -n open-cluster-management-observability create secret tls observability-server-ca-certs --cert ./serverCACert.pem --key ./serverCAKey.pem
----

. Create the `observability-client-ca-certs` secret by using your certificate and private key. Run the following command:
+
----
oc -n open-cluster-management-observability create secret tls observability-client-ca-certs --cert ./clientCACert.pem --key ./clientCAKey.pem
----
