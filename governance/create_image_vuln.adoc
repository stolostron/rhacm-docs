[#creating-an-image-vulnerability-policy]
== Creating an image vulnerability policy

You can create a YAML for your image vulnerability policy from the command line interface (CLI) or from the console.
View the following sections to create an image vulnerability policy:

[#creating-an-image-vulnerability-policy-from-the-cli]
=== Creating an image vulnerability policy from the CLI

Complete the following steps to create an image vulnerability policy from the CLI:

. Create a YAML file for your image vulnerability policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl create -f imagevulnpolicy-1.yaml
----

. Apply the policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl apply -f <imagevuln-policy-file-name>  --namespace=<namespace>
----

. List and verify the policies by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get imagevulnpolicy --namespace=<namespace>
----

Your image vulnerability policy is created.

[#viewing-your-image-vulnerability-policy-from-the-cli]
==== Viewing your image vulnerability policy from the CLI

Complete the following steps to view your image vulnerability policy from the CLI:

. View details for a specific image vulnerability policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get imagevulnpolicy <policy-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
----

. View a description of your image vulnerability policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl describe imagevulnpolicy <name> -n <namespace>

[#creating-an-image-vulnerability-policy-from-the-console]
=== Creating an image vulnerability policy from the console

As you create an image vulnerability policy from the console, a YAML file is also created in the YAML editor.
Complete the following steps to create the image vulnerability policy from the console:

. Log in to your cluster from the console.
. From the navigation menu, click *Governance*.
. Click *Create policy*.
. Select *ImageManifestVulnPolicy* from the _Specifications_ field.
Parameter values are automatically set.
You can edit your values.
. Click *Create*.

An image vulnerability policy is created.

[#viewing-image-vulnerability-violations-from-the-console]
=== Viewing image vulnerability violations from the console

. From the navigation menu, click *Governance* to view a table list of your policies.
. Select *`policy-imagemanifestvulnpolicy`* > *_Status_* to view the cluster location of the violation.
+
Your image vulnerability violation might resemble the following:
+
----
imagemanifestvulns exist and should be deleted: [sha256.7ac7819e1523911399b798309025935a9968b277d86d50e5255465d6592c0266] in namespace default; [sha256.4109631e69d1d562f014dd49d5166f1c18b4093f4f311275236b94b21c0041c0] in namespace calamari; [sha256.573e9e0a1198da4e29eb9a8d7757f7afb7ad085b0771bc6aa03ef96dedc5b743, sha256.a56d40244a544693ae18178a0be8af76602b89abe146a43613eaeac84a27494e, sha256.b25126b194016e84c04a64a0ad5094a90555d70b4761d38525e4aed21d372820] in namespace open-cluster-management-agent-addon; [sha256.64320fbf95d968fc6b9863581a92d373bc75f563a13ae1c727af37450579f61a] in namespace openshift-cluster-version
----

. Navigate to your {ocp-short} console by selecting the _Cluster_ link.
. From the navigation menu on the {ocp-short} console, click *Administration* > *Custom Resource Definitions*.
. Select *`imagemanifestvulns`* > *_Instances_ tab* to view all of the `imagemanifestvulns` instances.
. Select an entry to view more details.

[#updating-image-vulnerability-policies]

Learn to update image vulnerability policies by viewing the following section.

[#disabling-image-vulnerability-policies]
=== Disabling image vulnerability policies

Complete the following steps to disable your image vulnerability policy:

. Log in to your {product-title} console.
. From the navigation menu, click *Governance* to view a table list of your policies.
. Disable your policy by clicking the *Actions* icon > *Disable*.
The _Disable Policy_ dialog box appears.
. Click *Disable policy*.

Your policy is disabled.

[#deleting-an-image-vulnerability-policy]
== Deleting an image vulnerability policy

Delete the image vulnerability policy from the CLI or the console.

* Delete an image vulnerability policy from the CLI:
 .. Delete a certificate policy by running the following command:

+
----
kubectl delete policy <imagevulnpolicy-name> -n <namespace>
----
+
After your policy is deleted, it is removed from your target cluster or clusters.

 .. Verify that your policy is removed by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get policy <imagevulnpolicy-name> -n <namespace>
----
* Delete an image vulnerability policy from the console:
 .. From the navigation menu, click *Governance* to view a table list of your policies.
 .. Click the *Actions* icon for the policy you want to delete in the policy violation table.
 .. Click *Remove*.
 .. From the _Remove policy_ dialog box, click *Remove policy*.

Your image vulnerability policy is deleted.
