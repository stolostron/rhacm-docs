[#creating-a-certificate-policy]
== Creating a certificate policy

You can create a YAML file for your certificate policy from the command line interface (CLI) or from the console.
View the following sections to create a certificate policy:

[#creating-a-certificate-policy-from-the-cli]
=== Creating a certificate policy from the CLI

Complete the following steps to create a certificate policy from the CLI:

. Create a YAML file for your certificate policy.
Run the following command:
+
----
kubectl create -f policy-1.yaml
----

. Apply the policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl apply -f <certificate-policy-file-name>  --namespace=<namespace>
----

. Verify and list the policies by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get certificatepolicy --namespace=<namespace>
----

Your certificate policy is created.

[#viewing-your-certificate-policy-from-the-cli]
==== Viewing your certificate policy from the CLI

Complete the following steps to view your certificate policy from the CLI:

. View details for a specific certificate policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get certificatepolicy <policy-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
----

. View a description of your certificate policy by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl describe certificatepolicy <name> -n <namespace>
----

[#creating-a-certificate-policy-from-the-console]
=== Creating a certificate policy from the console

As you create a certificate policy from the console, a YAML file is also created in the YAML editor.
Complete the following steps to create a certificate policy from the console:

. Log in to your cluster from the console.
. From the navigation menu, click *Governance*.
. Click *Create policy*.
. Select _CertificatePolicy_ for the _Specifications_ parameter. Values for the remaining parameters are automatically set when you select the policy. You can edit your values.
. Click *Create*.

A certificate policy is created.

[#viewing-your-certificate-policy-from-the-console]
==== Viewing your certificate policy from the console

You can view any certificate policy and its status from the console.

. Log in to your cluster from the console.
. From the navigation menu, click *Governance* to view a table list of your policies.
+
*Note*: You can filter the table list of your policies by selecting the _Policies_ tab or _Cluster violations_ tab.

. Select one of your policies to view more details. The _Details_ tab and _Status_ tab are displayed. 

. To view the compliance status of your policy, select the _Status_ tab. Click the _View history_ link to view a list of violation messages.

[#updating-certificate-policies]
== Updating certificate policies

[#bringing-your-own-certificates]
=== Bringing your own certificates

You can monitor your own certificates with the certificate policy controller.
You must complete one of the following requirements to monitor your own certificates:

* Create a Kubernetes TLS Secret for your certificate.
* Add the label `certificate_key_name` into your Kubernetes secret to monitor your certificates.

Create a Kubernetes TLS secret to monitor your own certificates by running the following command:

----
kubectl -n <namespace> create secret tls <secret name> --cert=<path to certificate>/<certificate name> --key=<path to key>/<key name>
----

[#adding-a-label-into-your-kubernetes-secret]
=== Adding a label into your Kubernetes secret

Update the `metadata` parameter in your TLS Secret by adding the `certificate_key_name` label.
Run the following command to add the `certificate_key_name` label:

----
kubectl label secret my-certificate -n default certificate_key_name=cert
----

Your updated TLS Secret might resemble the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-certificate
  namespace: default
  labels:
    certificate_key_name: cert
type: Opaque
data:
  cert: <Certificate Data>
  key: <Private Key Data>
----

*Note:* When you add the label from the console, you must manually add the label into the TLS Secret YAML file.

[#disabling-certificate-policies]
=== Disabling certificate policies

When you create a certificate policy, it is enabled by default.
Complete the following steps to disable a certificate policy from the CLI or the console:

* Disable a certificate policy from the console:
 .. Log in to your {product-title} console.
 .. From the navigation menu, click *Governance* to view a table list of your policies.
 .. Disable your policy by clicking the *Actions* icon > *Disable*.
The _Disable Policy_ dialog box appears.
 .. Click *Disable policy*.

Your policy is disabled.

[#deleting-a-certificate-policy]
== Deleting a certificate policy

Delete the certificate policy from the CLI or the console.

* Delete a certificate policy from the CLI:
 .. Delete a certificate policy by running the following command:

+
----
kubectl delete policy <cert-policy-name> -n <namespace>
----
+
After your policy is deleted, it is removed from your target cluster or clusters.

 .. Verify that your policy is removed by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl get policy <policy-name> -n <namespace>
----
* Delete a certificate policy from the console:
 .. From the navigation menu, click *Governance* to view a table list of your policies.
 .. Click the *Actions* icon for the policy you want to delete in the policy violation table.
 .. Click *Remove*.
 .. From the _Remove policy_ dialog box, click *Remove policy*.

Your certificate policy is deleted.
