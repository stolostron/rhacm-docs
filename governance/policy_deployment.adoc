= Policy deployment

Kubernetes custom resource definition instances are used to create policies. You are responsible for ensuring that the managed cloud environment meets internal enterprise security standards for software engineering, secure engineering, resiliency, security, and regulatory compliance for workloads hosted on Kubernetes clusters.

[#deployment-options]
== Deployment options

The `CertificatePolicy`, `ConfigurationPolicy`, and `OperatorPolicy` policies and Gatekeeper constraints can be deployed to your managed clusters in two ways. You can deploy policies to your managed clusters by using the _Hub cluster policy framework_ or _Deploying policies with external tools_. View the following descriptions of each option: 

Hub cluster policy framework:: The first approach is to leverage the policy framework on the hub cluster. This involves defining the policies and Gatekeeper constraints within a `Policy` object on the hub cluster and leveraging a `Placement` and `PlacementBinding` to select which clusters the policies get deployed to. The policy framework handles the delivery to the managed cluster and the status aggregation back to the hub cluster. The `Policy` objects are represented in the _Policies_ table in the {acm} console.

Deploying policies with external tools:: Alternatively, you can use an external tool, such as {gitops}, to deliver the policies and Gatekeeper constraints directly to the managed cluster. Your policies are shown in the _Discovered policies_ table in the {acm-short} console and can be a helpful option if a configuration management strategy is already in place, but there is a desire to supplement that with {acm-short} policies.

=== Policy deployment comparison table

//added the table but still need to make updates and have questions
See the following comparison table to learn which option supports specific features, which helps you make a decision on which deployment strategy is more suitable for your use case:

|===
| Feature | Policy framework | Deployed with external tools

| Hub cluster templating
| Yes
| No

| Managed cluster templating
| Yes
| Yes

| {acm-short} console support
| Yes
| Yes through the _Discover policies_ table. Policies that are deployed with external tools are not displayed from the Governance Overview dashboard. You must enable Search on your managed cluster.

| Policy grouping
| Yes, through the `Policy` and `PolicySet` resources.
| Not directly, but `ArgoCD` application objects per grouping gives a high-level status.

| Compliance history
| Last 10 events per cluster per policy stored on the hub cluster.
| No, but can be scraped from the controller logs on each managed cluster.

| Policy dependencies
| Yes
| No, but Argo CD sync waves can be an alternative

| Policy Generator
| Yes
| No

| {gitops-short} health checks
| Yes
| Yes

| Policy compliance history(Technology Preview) 
| Yes
| No

| {gitops-short} applying native Kubernetes manifests and {acm-short} policy on the managed cluster
| No, policy must be deployed on your {acm-short} hub cluster.
| Yes

| Get a policy status on the hub cluster using the Kubernetes API
| Yes, through the root Policy and replicated Policy objects in the managed cluster namespaces.
| No

| Policy compliance metric on the hub cluster for alerts
| Yes
| No
