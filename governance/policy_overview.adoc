[#policy-overview]
= Policy overview

To create and manage policies, gain visibility and remediate configurations to meet standards, use the {product-title} security policy framework. Kubernetes custom resource definition instances are used to create policies. You can create a policy in any namespace on the hub cluster except the cluster namespace. If you create a policy in the cluster namespace, it is deleted by {product-title-short}. Each {product-title-short} policy can have at least one or more templates. For more details about the policy elements, view the _Policy YAML table_ section on this page.

Each client and provider is responsible for ensuring that their managed cloud environment meets internal enterprise security standards for software engineering, secure engineering, resiliency, security, and regulatory compliance for workloads hosted on Kubernetes clusters.

[#prereqs-policy-overview]
== Prerequisites

* Each policy requires a `Placement` resource that defines the clusters that the policy document is applied to, and a `PlacementBinding` resource that binds the {product-title} policy. For more on how to define a `Placement` resource see link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/placement_overview.adoc#placement-overview[Placement overview] in the Cluster lifecycle documentation.
* You must create the `PlacementBinding` to bind your policy with a `Placement` in order to propagate the policy to the managed clusters.
* To use a `Placement` resource, you must bind a `ManagedClusterSet` resource to the namespace of the `Placement` resource with a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource. Refer to link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/create_clustersetbinding.adoc#creating-managedclustersetbinding[Creating a _ManagedClusterSetBinding_ resource] for additional details.
* When you create a `Placement` resource for your policy from the console, the status of the placement toleration is automatically added to the `Placement` resource. See link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/taints_tolerations.adoc#adding-a-toleration-to-a-placement[Adding a toleration to a placement] for more details.  

*Best practice:* Use the command line interface (CLI) to make updates to the policies when you use the `Placement` resource.

[#policy-yaml-structure]
== Policy YAML structure

When you create a policy, you must include required parameter fields and values. Depending on your policy controller, you might need to include other optional fields and values. View the following YAML structure for policies:

[#policy-yaml-table]
== Policy YAML table

View the following table for policy parameter descriptions:

.Parameter table
|===
| Field | Optional or required | Description

| `apiVersion`
| Required
| Set the value to `policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1`.

| `kind`
| Required
| Set the value to `Policy` to indicate the type of policy.

| `metadata.name`
| Required
| The name for identifying the policy resource.

| `metadata.annotations`
| Optional
| Used to specify a set of security details that describes the set of standards the policy is trying to validate. All annotations documented here are represented as a string that contains a comma-separated list.

*Note:* You can view policy violations based on the standards and categories that you define for your policy on the _Policies_ page, from the console.

| `bindingOverrides.remediationAction`
| Optional
| When this parameter is set to `enforce`, it provides a way for you to override the remediation action of the related `PlacementBinding` resources for configuration policies. The default value is `null`.

| `subFilter`
| Optional
| Set this parameter to `restriction` to select a subset of bound policies. The default value is `null`.

| `annotations.policy.open-cluster-management.io/standards`
| Optional
| The name or names of security standards the policy is related to.
For example, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Payment Card Industry (PCI).

| `annotations.policy.open-cluster-management.io/categories`
| Optional
| A security control category represent specific requirements for one or more standards.
For example, a System and Information Integrity category might indicate that your policy contains a data transfer protocol to protect personal information, as required by the HIPAA and PCI standards.

| `annotations.policy.open-cluster-management.io/controls`
| Optional
| The name of the security control that is being checked.
For example, Access Control or System and Information Integrity.

| `spec.disabled`
| Required
| Set the value to `true` or `false`. The `disabled` parameter provides the ability to enable and disable your policies.

| `spec.remediationAction`
| Optional
| Specifies the remediation of your policy. The parameter values are `enforce` and `inform`. If specified, the `spec.remediationAction` value that is defined overrides any `remediationAction` parameter defined in the child policies in the `policy-templates` section. For example, if the `spec.remediationAction` value is set to `enforce`, then the `remediationAction` in the `policy-templates` section is set to `enforce` during runtime.

| `spec.copyPolicyMetadata`
| Optional
| Specifies whether the labels and annotations of a policy should be copied when replicating the policy to a managed cluster. If you set to `true`, all of the labels and annotations of the policy are copied to the replicated policy. If you set to `false`, only the policy framework specific policy labels and annotations are copied to the replicated policy.

| `spec.dependencies`
| Optional
| Used to create a list of dependency objects detailed with extra considerations for compliance.

| `spec.policy-templates`
| Required
| Used to create one or more policies to apply to a managed cluster.

| `spec.policy-templates.extraDependencies`
| Optional
| For policy templates, this is used to create a list of dependency objects detailed with extra considerations for compliance.

| `spec.policy-templates.ignorePending`
| Optional
| Used to mark a policy template as compliant until the dependency criteria is verified. 

*Important:* Some policy kinds might not support the enforce feature.
