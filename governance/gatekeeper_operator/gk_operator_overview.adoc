= {gate} overview 

The {gate} installs Gatekeeper which is a validating webhook with auditing capabilities. Install the {gate} on a {ocp} cluster from the {ocp} operator catalog. With {acm}, you can install Gatekeeper on your hub cluster by using the {gate} policy. After you install Gatekeeper, use it for the following benefits: 

- Deploy and check Gatekeeper `ConstraintTemplates` and constraints on managed clusters by using the {acm-short} policy integration. 
- Enforce Kubernetes custom resource definition-based policies that run with your Open Policy Agent (OPA).
- Evaluate Kubernetes resource compliance requests for the Kubernetes API by using the Gatekeeper constraints.
- Use OPA as the policy engine and use Rego as the policy language.

*Prerequisite:* You need a {acm} or {ocp} Plus subscription to install Gatekeeper and apply Gatekeeper policies to your cluster.
