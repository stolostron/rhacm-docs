= Integrating Gatekeeper constraints and constraint templates

To create Gatekeeper policies, use `ConstraintTemplates` and constraints. Add templates and constraints to the `policy-templates` of a `Policy` resource. View the following YAML examples that use Gatekeeper constraints in {acm-short} policies:

* `ConstraintTemplates` and constraints: Use the Gatekeeper integration feature by using {acm-short} policies for multicluster distribution of Gatekeeper constraints and Gatekeeper audit results aggregation on the hub cluster. The following example defines a Gatekeeper `ConstraintTemplate` and constraint (`K8sRequiredLabels`) to ensure the `gatekeeper` label is set on all namespaces:

<1> Since the `remediationAction` is set to `inform`, the `enforcementAction` field of the Gatekeeper constraint is overridden to `warn`. This means that Gatekeeper detects and warns you about creating or updating a namespace that is missing the `gatekeeper` label. If the policy `remediationAction` is set to `enforce`, the Gatekeeper constraint `enforcementAction` field is overridden to `deny`. In this context, this configuration prevents any user from creating or updating a namespace that is missing the `gatekeeper` label.
+
<2> *Optional:* Set a severity value for the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/severity` annotation for each Gatekeeper constraint or constraint template. Valid values are the same as for other {acm-short} policy types: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`.
+
With the previous policy, you might receive the following policy status message: `warn - you must provide labels: {"gatekeeper"} (on Namespace default); warn - you must provide labels: {"gatekeeper"} (on Namespace gatekeeper-system)`. When you delete Gatekeeper constraints or `ConstraintTemplates` from a policy, the constraints and `ConstraintTemplates` are also deleted from your managed cluster.
+
To view the Gatekeeper audit results for a specific managed cluster from the console, go to to the policy template _Results_ page. If search is enabled, view the YAML of the Kubernetes objects that failed the audit. 
+
*Notes:* 

- The _Related resources_ section is only available when the Gatekeeper version 3.9 or newer generates the audit results. 
- The Gatekeeper audit runs every minute by default. Audit results are sent back to the hub cluster to be viewed in the {acm-short} policy status of the managed cluster.

* `policy-gatekeeper-admission`: Use the `policy-gatekeeper-admission` configuration policy within a {acm-short} policy to check for Kubernetes API requests denied by the Gatekeeper admission webhook. View the following example:
