= Operator channels

With the {gate}, you have access to two types of channels to help you make upgrades. These channels are the `stable` channel and the `y-stream version` channel.

With the `stable` channel, you can access the latest available version, whether it is an `x-stream`, `y-stream`, or `z-stream`. The `stable` channel includes the latest version of the latest `y-stream` channel.

With the `y-stream version` channel, you can access all the `z-stream` versions for a particular `y-stream`.
