[#using-metrics]
= Using the metrics service

You can use metrics to monitor component health across {product-title}. Many custom metrics are documented in the link:https://github.com/stolostron/metrics-chronicle#application-metrics[Metrics chronicle overview].

[#accessing-hub-metrics]
== Accessing the hub cluster metrics service

To view the collected metrics, you must expose the metrics service on the hub cluster. If your metrics are already exposed in the Grafana dashboard, this procedure is optional.

From the {ocp-short} console, find the metrics service. Click *Observe* > *Metrics*.

If you do not see the metrics in the Grafana dashboard, Grafana Explorer, or in the {ocp-short} console, Prometheus might not be configured to scrape metrics. Continue with _Scrapping with Prometheus_ to expose your metrics.

[#scraping-prometheus]
== Scraping with Prometheus

You can use Prometheus to expose metrics that are not exposed from the product console. See the procedures for both the hub and managed cluster metrics.

[#scraping-hub]
=== Scraping the hub cluster

See the following procedure to expose metrics for the hub cluster. These files are within the `openshift-monitoring` namespace:

. Create a `ServiceMonitor` for collecting services and exposing metrics. See the following YAML example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: hub-subscription-metrics
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
spec:
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
    - open-cluster-management
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hub-subscription-metrics
----

. Run the following command to apply the file:

+
----
oc apply -f
----

. Create a `Role` for setting the permissions for monitoring. See the following YAML file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: prometheus-k8s-monitoring
  namespace: open-cluster-management
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - services
  - endpoints
  - pods
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
- apiGroups:
  - extensions
  resources:
  - ingresses
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
- apiGroups:
  - networking.k8s.io
  resources:
  - ingresses
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
----

. Run the following command to apply the file:

+
----
oc apply -f
----

. Create a `RoleBinding` for binding the role to the Prometheus monitoring
`ServiceAccount`, as it is in the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: prometheus-k8s-monitoring-binding
  namespace: open-cluster-management
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: prometheus-k8s-monitoring
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: prometheus-k8s
  namespace: monitoring
----

. Run the following command to apply the file:

+
----
oc apply -f
----

. To verify, run the following query in the dashboard to find metrics that are reported by the Subscription Operator Metrics Service:

+
----
{service="hub-subscription-metrics"}
----

[#scraping-managed]
=== Scraping the managed cluster

See the following procedure to expose metrics for managed clusters. These files are within the `openshift-monitoring` namespace:

. Create a `ServiceMonitor` for collecting services exposing metrics. See the following YAML file example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: mc-subscription-metrics
  namespace: openshift-monitoring

    matchNames:
    - open-cluster-management-agent-addon
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mc-subscription-metrics
----

. Run the following command to apply your file:

+
----
oc apply -f
----

. Create a `Role` for setting the permissions for monitoring. See the following YAML file example:

+
[source,yaml]

----

. Run the following command to apply the file:

+
----
oc apply -f
----

. Create a `RoleBinding` for binding the `Role` to the Prometheus monitoring
`ServiceAccount`:

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
