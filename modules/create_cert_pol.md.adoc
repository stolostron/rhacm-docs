[#updating-certificate-policies]
== Updating certificate policies

[#bringing-your-own-certificates]
=== Bringing your own certificates

You can monitor your own certificates with the certificate policy controller.
You must complete one of the following requirements to monitor your own certificates:

* Create a Kubernetes TLS Secret for your certificate.
* Add the label `certificate_key_name` into your Kubernetes secret to monitor your certificates.

Create a Kubernetes TLS secret to monitor your own certificates by running the following command:

----
   kubectl -n <namespace> create secret tls <secret name> --cert=<path to certificate>/<certificate name> --key=<path to key>/<key name>
----

[#adding-a-label-into-your-kubernetes-secret]
=== Adding a label into your Kubernetes secret

Update the `metadata` parameter in your TLS Secret by adding the `certificate_key_name` label.
Run the following command to add the `certificate_key_name` label:

----
   kubectl label secret my-certificate -n default certificate_key_name=cert
----

Your updated TLS Secret might resemble the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: my-certificate
     namespace: default
     labels:
       certificate_key_name: cert
   type: Opaque
   data:
     cert: <Certificate Data>
     key: <Private Key Data>
----

NOTE: When you add the label from the console, you must manually add the label into the TLS Secret YAML file.

[#disabling-certificate-policies]

 .. Log in to your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console.
 .. From the navigation menu, click *Govern risk* to view a table list of your policies.
 .. Disable your policy by clicking the *Options* icon > *Disable*.

// verify command `namespace`
+
----
 kubectl delete policy <cert-policy-name> -n <mcm namespace>
----
+
After your policy is deleted, it is removed from your target cluster or clusters.

 .. Verify that your policy is removed by running the following command:
+
----
 kubectl get policy <policy-name> -n <mcm namespace>
----
* Delete a certificate policy from the console:
 .. From the navigation menu, click *Govern risk* to view a table list of your policies.
