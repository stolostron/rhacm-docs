[#importing-an-existing-cluster-with-the-console]
= Importing an existing cluster with the console

After you install Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, you are ready to import a cluster to manage.
You can import from both the console and the CLI.
Follow this procedure to import from the console.
You need your terminal for authentication during this procedure.

* <<gui_prerequisites,Prerequisites>>
* <<importing-a-cluster,Importing a cluster>>
* <<removing-an-imported-cluster,Removing a cluster>>

[#gui_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* You need a Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes hub cluster deployed.
* You need a cluster that you want to manage and Internet connectivity.
* Install `kubectl`.
To install `kubectl`, see _Install and Set Up kubectl_ in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-macos[Kubernetes documentation].

// Optionally, the Visual Web Terminal supports both `kubectl` and `oc` commands and can target alternative `contexts` to work with remote clusters. (wait for testing, elder sending RFE, see Brandi or elder for history here)

* You need the `base64` command line tool.

*Required user type or access level*: Cluster administrator

[#importing-a-cluster]
== Importing a cluster

You can import existing clusters from the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console for each of the available cloud providers.

NOTE: A hub cluster cannot manage _any_ other hub cluster;
you must import an existing cluster.

. From the navigation menu, hover over *Automate infrastructure* and click *Clusters*.
. Click *Add cluster*.
. Click *Import an existing cluster*.
. Provide a cluster name.
By default, the namespace is set to the same value as your cluster name.
*Best practice:* Leave the namespace value and do not edit.
. *Optional:* Click to expand *Edit cluster import YAML file* and modify the endpoint configuration.
+
See <<yaml-parameters-and-descriptions,Table 1.
YAML file parameters and descriptions>> for details about each parameter.

. *Optional*: After you import, you can add labels by clicking *Configure advanced parameters* and use these labels to search.
. Click *Generate Command* to retrieve the command to deploy the `multicluster-endpoint`.
. From the _Import an existing cluster_ window, hover and click the *Copy command* icon to copy the import command and the token that you are provided.
You must click the *Copy* icon to receive the accurate copy.
. From your terminal, authenticate to your managed cluster.
Configure your `kubectl` for your targeted managed cluster.

See xref:install/supported_clouds[Supported cloud providers] to learn how to configure your `kubectl`.

. To deploy the `multicluster-endpoint` to the managed cluster, run the command that you generated and copied from _step 8_.
. Click *View cluster* to view the _Overview_ page and a summary of your cluster.

*Note* You can continue to import more clusters.
Click *Import another* to repeat the process.
