[#access-your-console]
== Access your console

* Access from the Red Hat OpenShift console:
 .. From the left-hand navigation, click *Networking* > *Routes*
 .. From the _Project_ menu, select the namespace where Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes is installed.
 .. Find `multicloud-console` and click the URL from the `Location` column.
* Access the console from the Red Hat OpenShift CLI:
 .. While logged in to OpenShift, run the following command to find the route, where `<namespace-from-install>` is the namespace where you installed Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes:

+
----
oc get routes -n <namespace-from-install>
----
 .. Find the `multicloud-console` name and the `Host/Port` columns to get your URL.

[#welcome-page]
== Welcome page

From the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes Welcome page, you get more information about the product and you can access header features, such as _Search_ and _Create resource_.
Also from the _Header_, you can click the *Help* (?) icon to view the _About_ page and the documentation.
From the _User_ menu, you can access the _Configure Client_ page.
Additionally, you can use the xref:vwt_search.adoc[Visual Web Terminal].

[#observe-environment-details]
== Observe environment details

Reorganize your dashboard.
You can personalize your view of the Overview dashboard by reorganizing the resource overview cards.
You can view the following information about your clusters:

* Name of the cloud service with the number of clusters
* Cluster compliance
* Pod details
* Pod status
* Cluster resources (VCPU/Memory usage)
* Storage usage

Additionally, the Heatmap displays color-coordinated boxes that represent the VCPU usage threshold of your nodes.

[#filtering-your-results]
=== Filtering your results

You can personalize your view of the page by using the filtering feature.
Click *Filter results* to specify what information is displayed on your page.

[#automate-infrastructure]
== Automate infrastructure

Create clusters or bare metal assets, or import existing clusters.
Scale up or down and delete clusters as needed.
For more information, see xref:manage_cluster/intro.adoc[Managing your clusters with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes]

[#manage-applications-technology-preview]
== Manage applications (Technology preview)

Click *New application* to edit a `.yaml` file and create your application.
Click Resources to view the information of each application.
For more information about application resources, see xref:../manage_applications/overview.adoc[Application management (Technology preview)].

[#viewing-your-pod-health]
=== Viewing your pod health

View the pod health for all of your clusters by expanding the Heatmap.

Click *Show details* to view the map.
The size of the color-coordinated boxes represents the number of nodes on your cluster.
Hover your cursor over the box to view the response time of your cluster.

[#topology-page]
== Topology page

The Topology page uses information from Weave Scope probe to display Kubernetes objects within a cluster.
You can view hub cluster resources.
As you configure managed clusters, you see more clusters in the Topology view.

To reduce the graphics on the page, you can filter the view by Clusters, Namespaces, and Labels.
You can also filter the design by selecting the icon that represents the Kubernetes objects.

Learn more about the tabs that are available from the Topology page:

* Clusters: You can monitor your cluster network, object network, and security policies in a graphical format.
View your hub clusters, all your managed clusters, and monitor security violations.
* Networking: View Kubernetes objects for each cluster and any networks between your Kubernetes objects.
Objects display changes if they were recently started.
Pods also indicate `pending` and `failed` status.
* Policies: View the policy, policy placement, and clusters that are being validated.
Check for violations for the selected policy.

[#governance-and-risk-dashboard]
== Governance and risk dashboard

Use the Governance and risk dashboard to create and manage policies and policy controllers.
For more information, see xref:../governance/compliance_intro.adoc[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes Governance and risk].

[#search]
== Search

For Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, Search provides visibility into your resources across all your clusters.

NOTE: You can type any text value in the _Search box_ and results include anything with that value from any property, such as a name or namespace.
For example, if you search for `RedHat`, you can receive results such as `RedHat123`.

For more specific search results, include the property in your search.
For example, search for `name:RedHat` to search only in the `name` property.

. Click *Search* in the navigation menu.
. Type a word in the _Search box_, then Search finds your resources that contain that value.

* As you search for resources, you receive other resources that are related to your original search result, which help you visualize how the resources interact with other resources in the system.
* Search returns and lists each cluster with the resource that you search.
For resources in the _hub_ cluster, the cluster name is displayed as _local-cluster_.
* Your search results are grouped by `kind`, and each resource `kind` is grouped in a table.
* Your search options depend on your cluster objects.
You can refine your results with specific labels.
Search is case-sensitive when you query labels.
See the following examples: name, namespace, status, and other resource fields.
Auto-complete provides suggestions to refine your search.
See the following example:
 ** Search for a single field, such as `kind:pod` to find all pod resources.
 ** Search for multiple fields, such as `kind:pod namespace:default` to find the pods in the default namespace.

NOTE: Any user can search for resources, but results are based on your role-based access control assignment.
Additionally, if you save and share a Search query with another user, returned results depend on access level for that user.
For more information on role access, see _Using RBAC Authorization_ in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Kubernetes documentation].

* You can also search with conditions by using characters, such as `+>, >=, <, <=, !=+`.
+
See the following example:

 ** Search for `kind:pod status:!Running` to find all pod resources where the status is not `Running`.
 ** Search for `kind:pod restarts:>1` to find all pods that restarted at least twice.

. If you want to save your search, click the *Save disk* icon.
