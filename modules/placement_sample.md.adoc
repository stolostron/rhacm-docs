[#placement-rules-samples]
= Placement rules samples

Placement rules (`placementrule.apps.open-cluster-management.io`) define the target clusters where deployables can be deployed.
Use placement rules to help you facilitate the multi-cluster deployment of your deployables.

[#example-placement-rule-definition-yaml-structure]
== Example placement rule definition YAML structure

The following YAML structure shows the required fields for a placement rule and some of the common optional fields.
Your YAML structure needs to include some required fields and values.
Depending on your application management requirements, you might need to include other optional fields and values.
You can compose your own YAML content with any tool.
