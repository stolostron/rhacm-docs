[#compliance-history-api]
= Policy compliance history (Technology Preview)

== Overview

The policy compliance history API is an optional technical preview feature if you want long-term storage of {acm} policy compliance events in a queryable format. You can use the API to get additional details such as the `spec` field to audit and troubleshoot your policy, and get compliance events when a policy is disabled or removed from a cluster. The policy compliance history API can also generate a comma-separated values (CSV) spreadsheet of policy compliance events to help you with auditing and troubleshooting.

=== Listing policy compliance events

`/api/v1/compliance-events`

This lists all policy compliance events that you have access to by default. The response format is as follows and is sorted by `event.timestamp` in descending order by default:

[source,json]

The following optional query parameters are accepted. Notice that those without descriptions just filter on the field it references. The parameter value `null` represents no value. Additionally, multiple values can be specified with commas. For example, `?cluster.name=cluster1,cluster2` for "or" filtering. Commas can be escaped with `\`, if necessary.

.Table of query parameters
|===
| Query argument | Description 

| cluster.cluster_id
|

| cluster.name
|

| direction 
| The direction to sort by. This defaults to `desc`, which represents descending order. The supported values are `asc` and `desc`. 

| event.compliance
|

| event.message_includes
| A filter for compliance messages that include the input string. Only a single value is supported.

| event.message_like
| A SQL `LIKE` filter for compliance messages. The percent sign (`%`) represents a wildcard of zero or more characters. The underscore sign (`_`) represents a wildcard of a single character. For example `%configmaps [%my-configmap%]%` matches any configuration policy compliance message that refers to the config map `my-configmap`.

| event.reported_by
|

| event.timestamp
|

| event.timestamp_after
| An RFC 3339 timestamp to indicate only compliance events after this time should be shown. For example, `2024-02-28T16:32:57Z`.

| event.timestamp_before
| An RFC 3339 timestamp to indicate only compliance events before this time should be shown. For example, `2024-02-28T16:32:57Z`.

| id
|

| include_spec
| A flag to include the `spec` field of the policy in the return value. This is not set by default.

| page
| The page number in the query. This defaults to `1`.

| parent_policy.categories
|

| parent_policy.controls
|

| parent_policy.id
|

| parent_policy.name
|

| parent_policy.namespace
|

| parent_policy.standards
|

| per_page
| The number of compliance events returned per page. This defaults to `20` and cannot be larger than `100`.

| policy.apiGroup
|

| policy.id
|

| policy.kind
|

| policy.name
|

| policy.namespace
|

| policy.severity
|

| sort
| The field to sort by. This defaults to `event.timestamp`. All fields except `policy.spec` and `event.metadata` are sortable by using dot notation. To specify multiple sort options, use commas such as `?sort=policy.name,policy.namespace`.

=== Selecting a single policy compliance event 

`/api/v1/compliance-events/<id>`

You can select a single policy compliance event by specifying its database ID. For example, `/api/v1/compliance-events/1` selects the compliance event with the ID of 1. The format of the return value is the following JSON:

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": 1,
  "cluster": {
    "name": "cluster2",
    "cluster_id": "415ce234-8dee-4cab-b99b-1f8f29dff461"
  },
  "parent_policy": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "etcd-encryption",
    "namespace": "policies",
    "catageories": ["CM Configuration Management"],
    "controls": ["CM-2 Baseline Configuration"],
    "standards": ["NIST SP 800-53"]
  },
  "policy": {
    "apiGroup": "policy.open-cluster-management.io",
    "id": 4,
    "kind": "ConfigurationPolicy",
    "name": "etcd-encryption",
    "namespace": "",
    "spec": {}
  },
  "event": {
    "compliance": "Compliant",
    "message": "configmaps [app-data] found as specified in namespace default",
    "timestamp": "2023-07-19T18:25:41.523Z",
    "metadata": {}
  }
}
----

=== Generating a spreadsheet

`/api/v1/reports/compliance-events`

You can generate a comma separated value (CSV) spreadsheet of compliance events for auditing and troubleshooting. It outputs the same and accepts the same query arguments as the `/api/v1/compliance-events` API endpoint. By default there is no `per_page` limitation set and there is no maximum for the `per_page` query argument. All the CSV headers are the same as the `/api/v1/compliance-events` API endpoint with underscores separating JSON objects. For example, the event timestamp has a header of `event_timestamp`.

== Authentication and Authorization
The policy compliance history API utilizes the OpenShift instance used by the {acm-short} hub cluster for authentication and authorization. You must provide your OpenShift token in the `Authorization` header of the HTTPS request.

To find your token, run the following command:
[source,bash]
----
oc whoami --show-token
----

=== Viewing compliance events

To view the compliance events for a managed cluster, you need access to complete the `get` `verb` for the `ManagedCluster` object on the {acm-short} hub cluster. For example, to view the compliance events of the `local-cluster` cluster, you might use the `open-cluster-management:view:local-cluster` `ClusterRole` or create your own resource as the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
 name: local-cluster-view
rules:
- apiGroups:
 - cluster.open-cluster-management.io
 resources:
 - managedclusters
 resourceNames:
 - local-cluster
 verbs:
 - get
----

To verify your access to a particular managed cluster, use the `oc auth can-i` command. For example, to check if you have access to the `local-cluster` managed cluster, run the following command:

----
oc auth can-i get managedclusters.cluster.open-cluster-management.io/local-cluster
----

=== Recording a compliance event

Users or service accounts with `patch` `verb` access in the `policies.policy.open-cluster-management.io/status` resource in the corresponding managed cluster namespace have access to record policy compliance events. The `governance-policy-framework` pod on managed clusters utilizes the `open-cluster-management-compliance-history-api-recorder` service account in the corresponding managed cluster namespace on the {acm-short} hub cluster to record compliance events. Each service account has the `open-cluster-management:compliance-history-api-recorder` `ClusterRole` bound to the managed cluster namespace. Restrict user and service account `patch` verb access to the policy `status` to ensure the trustworthiness of the data stored in the policy compliance history API.
