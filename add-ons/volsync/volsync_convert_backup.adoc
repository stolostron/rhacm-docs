= Converting a replicated image to a usable persistent volume claim

There might be a time when you need to use the replicated image to recover data or to create a new instance of a persistent volume claim. The copy of the image must be converted to a persistent volume claim before it can be used. To convert a replicated image to a persistent volume claim, complete the following steps:

. When the replication is complete, identify the latest snapshot from the `ReplicationDestination` object by entering the following command:
+
----
$ kubectl get replicationdestination <destination> -n <destination-ns> --template={{.status.latestImage.name}}
----
Note the value of the latest snapshot for when you create your persistent volume claim.
+
Replace `destination` with the name of your replication destination. 
+
Replace `destination-ns` with the namespace of your destination. 

. Create a `pvc.yaml` file that resembles the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: <pvc-name>
  namespace: <destination-ns>
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  dataSource:
    kind: VolumeSnapshot
    apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
    name: <snapshot_to_replace>
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
----
+
Replace `pvc-name` with a name for your new persistent volume claim.
+
Replace `destination-ns` with the namespace where the persistent volume claim is located.  
+
Replace `snapshot_to_replace` with the `VolumeSnapshot` name that you found in the previous step.
+
You can update `resources.requests.storage` with a different value, but it is best practice when the value is at least the same size as the initial source persistent volume claim.

. Validate that your persistent volume claim is running in the environment by entering the following command:
+
----
$ kubectl get pvc -n <destination-ns>
----

Your original backup image is running as the main persistent volume claim.
