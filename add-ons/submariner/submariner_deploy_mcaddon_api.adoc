= Deploy Submariner with the ManagedClusterAddOn API

To deploy Submariner by using the `ManagedClusterAddOn` API, complete the following steps:

. Create a `ManagedClusterSet` resource on the hub cluster by using the instructions provided in the _Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets_ topic of the link:../../multicluster_engine/cluster_lifecycle/managedclustersets_intro.adoc#creating-a-managedclusterset[Creating and managing ManagedClusterSets] documentation. Your entry for the `ManagedClusterSet` should resemble the following content:

+
[source,yaml]
----   
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: ManagedClusterSet
metadata:
  name: <managed-cluster-set-name>
----
+
Replace `managed-cluster-set-name` with a name for the `ManagedClusterSet` that you are creating.
+
*Note:* The maximum length of the name of the Kubernetes namespace is 63 characters, so the maximum length of the `<managed-cluster-set-name>` is 56 characters. If the length of `<managed-cluster-set-name>` exceeds 56, the `<managed-cluster-set-name>` is truncated from the head.
+
After the `ManagedClusterSet` is created, the `submariner-addon` creates a namespace called `<managed-cluster-set-name>-broker` and deploys the Submariner broker to it.

. Create the `Broker` configuration on the hub cluster in the `<managed-cluster-set-name>-broker` namespace by customizing and applying YAML content that is similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: submariner.io/v1alpha1
kind: Broker
metadata:
     name: submariner-broker
     namespace: <managed-cluster-set-name>-broker
spec:
     globalnetEnabled: false
----
+
Replace `managed-cluster-set-name` with the name of the managed cluster. 
+
Set the the value of `globalnetEnabled` to `true` if you want to enable Submariner Globalnet in the `ManagedClusterSet`.

. Add one managed cluster to the `ManagedClusterSet` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc label managedclusters <managed-cluster-name> "cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=<managed-cluster-set-name>" --overwrite
----
+
Replace `<managed-cluster-name>` with the name of the managed cluster that you want to add to the `ManagedClusterSet`.
+
Replace `<managed-cluster-set-name>` with the name of the `ManagedClusterSet` to which you want to add the managed cluster. 

.  Deploy Submariner on the managed cluster by customizing and applying YAML content that is similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
     name: submariner
     namespace: <managed-cluster-name>
spec:
     installNamespace: submariner-operator
----
+
Replace `managed-cluster-name` with the name of the managed cluster that you want to use with Submariner. 
+
The `installNamespace` field in the spec of the `ManagedClusterAddOn` is the namespace on the managed cluster where it installs Submariner. Currently, Submariner must be installed in the `submariner-operator` namespace.
+
After the `ManagedClusterAddOn` is created, the `submariner-addon` deploys Submariner to the `submariner-operator` namespace on the managed cluster. You can view the deployment status of Submariner from the status of this `ManagedClusterAddOn`.
+
*Note:* The name of `ManagedClusterAddOn` must be `submariner`.

. Repeat steps three and four for all of the managed clusters that you want to enable Submariner on.

. After Submariner is deployed on the managed cluster, you can verify the Submariner deployment status by checking the status of submariner `ManagedClusterAddOn` by entering the following command: 
+
----
oc -n <managed-cluster-name> get managedclusteraddons submariner -oyaml
----
+
Replace `managed-cluster-name` with the name of the managed cluster.
+
In the status of the Submariner `ManagedClusterAddOn`, three conditions indicate the  deployment status of Submariner:
+
* `SubmarinerGatewayNodesLabeled` condition indicates whether there are labeled Submariner gateway nodes on the managed cluster.
* `SubmarinerAgentDegraded` condition indicates whether the Submariner is successfully deployed on the managed cluster.
* `SubmarinerConnectionDegraded` condition indicates how many connections are established on the managed cluster with Submariner.
