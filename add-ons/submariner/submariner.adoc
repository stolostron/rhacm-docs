[#submariner]
= Submariner multicluster networking and service discovery

The _Submariner_ service is an open source tool that can be used with {product-title} to provide direct networking between pods across two or more Kubernetes clusters in your environment, either on-premises or in the cloud. For more information about Submariner, see the https://submariner.io/[Submariner site].

You can enable Submariner on {ocp-short} clusters that are hosted in the following environments:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* IBM Cloud
* Microsoft Azure
* Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated
* VMware vSphere
* Bare metal
* Red Hat OpenStack Platform

{product-title} provides a Submariner component that you can deploy in your environment by using your hub cluster.

[#submariner-prereq]
== Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites before using Submariner:

* A credential to access the hub cluster with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* IP connectivity must be configured between the Gateway nodes. When connecting two clusters, at least one of the clusters must be accessible to the Gateway node using its public or private IP address designated to the Gateway node. See https://submariner.io/operations/nat-traversal[Submariner NAT Traversal] for more information.
* Firewall configuration across all nodes in each of the managed clusters must allow 4800/UDP in both directions.
* Firewall configuration on the Gateway nodes must allow ingress 8080/TCP so the other nodes in the cluster can access it.
* Firewall configuration open for 4500/UDP and any other ports that are used for IPsec traffic on the gateway nodes.
+
*Note:* This is configured automatically when your clusters are deployed in an AWS or GCP environment, but must be configured manually for clusters on other environments and for the firewalls that protect private clouds.
* The `managedcluster` name must follow the DNS label standard as defined in RFC 1123. This means the name must meet the following criteria:
+
- Contain at most 63 characters
- Contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-'
- Start with an alphanumeric character
- End with an alphanumeric character

[#submariner-subctl]
== subctl command utility

Submariner contains the `subctl` utility that provides additional commands that simplify running tasks on your Submariner environment. 

[#submariner-subctl-install]
=== Installing the subctl command utility

The `subctl` utility is shipped in a container image. Complete the following steps to install the `subctl` utility locally: 

. Download the https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/rhacm2/subctl-rhel8/6229131e49e7196373df7d3e[`subctl` container] and extract a compressed version of the `subctl` binary to `/tmp` by entering the following command:
+
----
oc image extract registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/subctl-rhel8:v0.13 --path=/dist/subctl-v0.13.0-linux-amd64.tar.xz:/tmp/ --confirm
----
+
*Note:* You might have to change `subctl-v0.13.0-linux-amd64.tar.xz` to the version of Submariner that you are using.  

. Decompress the `subctl` utility by entering the following command: 
+
----
tar -C /tmp/ -xf /tmp/subctl-v0.13.0-linux-amd64.tar.xz
----

. Install the `subctl` utility by entering the following command:
+
----
install -m744 /tmp/subctl-v0.13.0/subctl-v0.13.0-linux-amd64 /$HOME/.local/bin/subctl
----

[#submariner-subctl-command]
=== Using the subctl commands

After adding the utility to your path, view the following table for a brief description of the available commands:

|===
| https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#export-service[`export service`] | Creates a `ServiceExport` resource for the specified service, which enables other clusters in the Submariner deployment to discover the corresponding service. 
| https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#unexport-service[`unexport service`] | Removes the `ServiceExport` resource for the specified service, which prevents other clusters in the Submariner deployment from discovering the corresponding service. 
| https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#show[`show`] | Provides information about Submariner resources.
| https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#verify[`verify`] | Verifies connectivity, service discovery, and other Submariner features when Submariner is configured across a pair of clusters.
| https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#benchmark[`benchmark`] | Benchmarks throughput and latency across a pair of clusters that are enabled with Submariner or within a single cluster. 
| https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#diagnose[`diagnose`] | Runs checks to identify issues that prevent the Submariner deployment from working correctly. 
| https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#gather[`gather`] | Collects information from the clusters to help troubleshoot a Submariner deployment.
| https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#version[`version`] | Displays the version details of the `subctl` binary tool.
|===
//This is an example of a verticle table versus the tables based on the ascii changes. We will need to decide which to continue with but the majority is the vertical input for the same output. It's best to see the rest of the doc and all of us to have a source that looks the same. We can see what the ascii guide at Red Hat asks for. Please always start with our source to create new content. --bcs

[#submariner-globalnet]
== Globalnet

Globalnet is a feature included with the Submariner add-on which supports connectivity between clusters with overlapping CIDRs. Globalnet is a cluster set wide configuration, and can be selected when the first managed cluster is added to the cluster set. When Globalnet is enabled, each managed cluster is allocated a global CIDR from the virtual Global Private Network. The global CIDR is used for supporting inter-cluster communication.

If there is a chance that your clusters running Submariner might have overlapping CIDRs, consider enabling Globalnet. When using the {product-title-short} console, the `ClusterAdmin` can enable Globalnet for a cluster set by selecting the option *Enable Globalnet* when enabling the Submariner add-on for clusters in the cluster set. After you enable Globalnet, you cannot disable it without removing Submariner.

When using the {product-title-short} APIs, the `ClusterAdmin` can enable Globalnet by creating a `submariner-broker` object in the `<ManagedClusterSet>-broker` namespace. 

The `ClusterAdmin` role has the required permissions to create this object in the broker namespace. The `ManagedClusterSetAdmin` role, which is sometimes created to act as a proxy administrator for the cluster set, does not have the required permissions. To provide the required permissions, the `ClusterAdmin` must associate the role permissions for the `access-to-brokers-submariner-crd` to the `ManagedClusterSetAdmin` user.

Complete the following steps to create the `submariner-broker` object:

. Create `submariner-broker` object that specifies the Globalnet configuration by creating a YAML file named `submariner-broker.yaml` that contains content that resembles the following example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: submariner.io/v1alpha1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: submariner-broker
  namespace: <broker-namespace>
spec:
  globalnetEnabled: <true-or-false>
----
+
Replace `broker-namespace` with the name of your broker namespace.
+
Replace `true-or-false` with `true` to enable Globalnet. 

. Apply the file to your YAML file by entering the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f submariner-broker.yaml
----  

For more information about Globalnet, see https://submariner.io/getting-started/architecture/globalnet/[Globalnet controller] in the Submariner documentation.
