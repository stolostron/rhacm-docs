[#submariner]
= Submariner multicluster networking and service discovery

The _Submariner_ service is an open source tool that can be used with {product-title} to provide direct networking between pods across two or more Kubernetes clusters in your environment, either on-premises or in the cloud. For more information about Submariner, see the https://submariner.io/[Submariner website].

You can enable Submariner on {ocp-short} clusters that are hosted in the following environments:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* IBM Cloud
* Microsoft Azure
* Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated
* VMware vSphere
* Bare metal
* Red Hat OpenStack Platform

{product-title} provides a Submariner component that you can deploy in your environment by using your hub cluster.

[#submariner-prereq]
== Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites before using Submariner:

* A {product-title-short} hub cluster that is running on {ocp} version 4.6, or later, with Kubernetes version 1.19, or later.
* A credential to access the hub cluster with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* Two or more {ocp-short} managed clusters that are running on {ocp-short} version 4.4, or later, with Kubernetes version 1.17, or later, and are managed by the {product-title-short} hub cluster.
* Non-overlapping pod and service Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) ranges for clusters. **Note:** The upstream feature called _Globalnet_ allows overlapping CIDRs, but it is not currently supported for use with {product-title-short}.
* IP connectivity must be configured between the Gateway nodes. When connecting two clusters, at least one of the clusters must be accessible to the Gateway node using its public or private IP address designated to the Gateway node. See https://submariner.io/operations/nat-traversal[Submariner NAT Traversal] for more information.
* Firewall configuration across all nodes in each of the managed clusters must allow 4800/UDP in both directions.
* Firewall configuration on the Gateway nodes must allow ingress 8080/TCP so the other nodes in the cluster can access it.
* Firewall configuration open for 4500/UDP and any other ports that are used for IPsec traffic on the gateway nodes.
+
*Note:* This is configured automatically when your clusters are deployed in an AWS or GCP environment, but must be configured manually for clusters on other environments and for the firewalls that protect private clouds.
