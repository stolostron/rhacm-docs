= Deploying Submariner manually

Before you deploy Submariner with {product-title}, you must prepare the clusters on the hosting environment for the connection. Currently, you can use the `SubmarinerConfig` API to automatically prepare the clusters on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and VMware vSphere. For other platforms, you need to prepare them manually, see xref:../submariner_prepare_hosts.adoc#preparing-selected-hosts-to-deploy-submariner[Preparing selected hosts to deploy Submariner] for the steps.
