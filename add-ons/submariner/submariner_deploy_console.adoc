= Deploying Submariner with the console

You can deploy Submariner on {ocp} managed clusters that are deployed on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and VMware vSphere by using the {product-title} console. To deploy Submariner on other providers, follow the instructions in xref:../submariner/submariner_deploy_manual.adoc#deploying-submariner-manually[Deploying Submariner manually]. Complete the following steps to deploy Submariner with the {product-title} console:

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

. From the console navigation menu, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. On the _Clusters_ page, select the _Cluster sets_ tab. The clusters that you want enable with Submariner must be in the same cluster set. 

. If the clusters on which you want to deploy Submariner are already in the same cluster set, skip to step 5 to deploy Submariner.

. If the clusters on which you want to deploy Submariner are not in the same cluster set, create a cluster set for them by completing the following steps: 

.. Select *Create cluster set*.

.. Name the cluster set, and select *Create*.

.. Select *Manage resource assignments* to assign clusters to the cluster set.

.. Select the managed clusters that you want to connect with Submariner to add them to the cluster set.

.. Select *Review* to view and confirm the clusters that you selected.

.. Select *Save* to save the cluster set, and view the resulting cluster set page.

. On the cluster set page, select the _Submariner add-ons_ tab.

. Select *Install Submariner add-ons*.

. Select the clusters on which you want to deploy Submariner. 

. Enter the following information in the _Install Submariner add-ons_ editor:
+
* `AWS Access Key ID` - This field is only visible when you import an AWS cluster.
* `AWS Secret Access Key` - This field is only visible when you import an AWS cluster.
* `Google Cloud Platform service account JSON key` - This field is only visible when you import a Google Cloud Platform cluster.
* `Instance type` - The Amazon Web Services EC2 instance type of the gateway node that is created on the managed cluster. The default value is `c5d.large`. This field is only visible when your managed cluster environment is AWS.
* `IPsec NAT-T port` - The default value for the IPsec NAT traversal port is port `4500`. If your managed cluster environment is VMware vSphere, ensure that this port is opened on your firewalls.
* `Gateway count` - The number of worker nodes that are used to deploy the Submariner gateway component on your managed cluster. The default value is `1`. If the value is greater than 1, the Submariner gateway High Availability (HA) is automatically enabled.
* `Cable driver` - The Submariner gateway cable engine component that maintains the cross-cluster tunnels. The default value is `Libreswan IPsec`.

. Select *Next* at the end of the editor to move to the editor for the next cluster, and complete the editor for each of the remaining clusters that you selected. 

. Verify your configuration for each managed cluster.

. Click *Install* to deploy Submariner on the selected managed clusters. 
+
It might take several minutes for the installation and configuration to complete. You can check the Submariner status in the list on the _Submariner add-ons_ tab:
+
* `Connection status` indicates how many Submariner connections are established on the managed cluster. 
+
* `Agent status` indicates whether Submariner is successfully deployed on the managed cluster. The console might report a status of `Degraded` until it is installed and configured. 
+
* `Gateway nodes labeled` indicates how many worker nodes are labeled with the Submariner gateway label: `submariner.io/gateway=true` on the managed cluster.

Submariner is now deployed on the clusters.
