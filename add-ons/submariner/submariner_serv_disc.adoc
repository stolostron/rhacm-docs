= Enabling service discovery for Submariner

The `submariner-addon` component is a *technology preview* feature.

After Submariner is deployed into the same environment as your managed clusters, the routes are configured for secure IP routing between the pod and services across the clusters in the `ManagedClusterSet`. To make a service from a cluster visible and discoverable to other clusters in the `ManagedClusterSet`, you must create a `ServiceExport` object. After a service is exported with a `ServiceExport` object, you can access the the service by the following format: `<service>.<namespace>.svc.clusterset.local`. If multiple clusters export a service with the same name, and from the same namespace, they are recognized by other clusters as a single logical service. 

This example uses the `nginx` service in the `default` namespace, but you can discover any Kubernetes `ClusterIP` service or headless service: 

. Apply an instance of the `nginx` service on a managed cluster that is in the `ManagedClusterSet` by entering the following commands:
+
----
oc -n default create deployment nginx --image=nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:stable-alpine
oc -n default expose deployment nginx --port=8080
----

. Export the service by creating a `ServiceExport` entry that resembles the following content in the YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: multicluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceExport
metadata:
  name: <service-name>
  namespace: <service-namespace>
----
Replace `_service-name_` with the name of the service that you are exporting. In this example, it is `nginx`. 
Replace `_service-namespace_` with the name of the namespace where the service is located. In this example, it is `default`.

. Run the following command from a different managed cluster to confirm that it can access the `nginx` service:
+
----
oc -n default run --generator=run-pod/v1 tmp-shell --rm -i --tty --image quay.io/submariner/nettest -- /bin/bash curl nginx.default.svc.clusterset.local:8080
----

The `nginx` service discovery is now configured for Submariner.
