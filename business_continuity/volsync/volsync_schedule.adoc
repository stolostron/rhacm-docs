= Scheduling your synchronization

Select from three options when determining how you start your replications: always running, on a schedule, or manually. Scheduling your replications is an option that is often selected. 

The *Schedule* option runs replications at scheduled times. A schedule is defined by a `cronspec`, so the schedule can be configured as intervals of time or as specific times. The order of the schedule values are:

`"minute (0-59) hour (0-23) day-of-month (1-31) month (1-12) day-of-week (0-6)"`

The replication starts when the scheduled time occurs. Your setting for this replication option might resemble the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  trigger:
    schedule: "*/6 * * * *"
----

After enabling one of these methods, your synchronization schedule runs according to the method that you configured.

See the https://volsync.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[VolSync] documentation for additional information and options.
