= Backup and restore advanced configuration 

You can further configure backup and restore by viewing the following topics:

[#resource-requests-and-limits]
== Resource requests and limits customization

When Velero is initially installed, Velero pod is set to the default CPU and memory limits as defined in the following sample:

[source,yaml]
----
resources:
 limits:
   cpu: "1"
   memory: 256Mi
 requests:
   cpu: 500m
   memory: 128Mi
----

The limits from the previous sample work well with some scenarios, but might need to be updated when your cluster backs up a large number of resources. For instance, when back up is run on a hub cluster that manages 2000 clusters, then the Velero pod fails due to the out-of-memory error (OOM). The following configuration allows for the backup to complete for this scenario:

[source,yaml]
----
  limits:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: 1Gi
  requests:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 256Mi
----

To update the limits and requests for the Velero pod resource, you need to update the `DataProtectionApplication` resource and insert the `resourceAllocation` template for the Velero pod. View the following sample:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: velero
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
...
  configuration:
...
    velero:
      podConfig:
        resourceAllocations:
          limits:
            cpu: "2"
            memory: 1Gi
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 256Mi
