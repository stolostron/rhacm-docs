= Scheduling and restoring backups

Complete the following steps to schedule and restore backups:

. Use the backup and restore operator, `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, to create a backup schedule and use the `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resources to restore a backup.

. Run the following command to create a `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource:
+
----
oc create -f cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml
----
+
Your `cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml` resource might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: schedule-acm
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  veleroSchedule: 0 */2 * * * <1>
  veleroTtl: 120h <2>
----
+
<1> Create a backup every 2 hours
<2> *Optional:* Deletes scheduled backups after 120h. If not specified, the maximum Velero default value of 720h is used.
+
View the following descriptions of the `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` `spec` properties:
+
** `veleroSchedule` is a required property and defines a cron job for scheduling the backups.
** `veleroTtl` is an optional property and defines the expiration time for a scheduled backup resource. If not specified, the maximum default value set by Velero is used, which is `720h`.

. Check the status of your `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, which displays the definition for the three `schedule.velero.io` resources. Run the following command:
+
----
oc get BackupSchedule -n open-cluster-management-backup
----

. As a reminder, the restore operation is run on a different hub cluster for restore scenarios. To initiate a restore operation, create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource on the hub cluster where you want to restore backups.
+
*Note:* When you restore a backup on a new hub cluster, make sure that you shut down the previous hub cluster where the backup was created. If it is running, the previous hub cluster tries to reimport the managed clusters as soon as the managed cluster reconciliation finds that the managed clusters are no longer available.
+
You can use the cluster backup and restore operator, `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` and `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resources, to create a backup or restore resource. See the _cluster-backup-operator_ samples.
+
. Run the following command to create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource:
+
----
oc create -f cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml
----
+
Your resource might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupName: latest
----

. View the Velero `Restore` resource by running the following command:
+
----
oc get restore.velero.io -n open-cluster-management-backup
----

. View the {product-title-short} `Restore` events by running the following command:
+
----
oc describe restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io -n open-cluster-management-backup
----

[#extend-backup-data]
== Extending backup data

You can backup third-party resources with cluster backup and restore by adding the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label to the resources. The value of the label can be any string, including an empty string. Use a value that can help you identify the component that you are backing up. For example, use the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: idp` label if the components are provided by an IDP solution.

*Note:* Use the `cluster-activation` value for the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label if you want the resources to be restored when the managed clusters activation resources are restored. Restoring the managed clusters activation resources result in managed clusters being actively managed by the hub cluster, where the restore was started.

[#schedule-backup]
== Scheduling a cluster backup

A backup schedule is activated when you create the `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource. View the following `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` sample:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: schedule-acm
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  veleroSchedule: 0 */2 * * *
  veleroTtl: 120h
----

After you create a `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, run the following command to get the status of the scheduled cluster backups:

----
oc get BackupSchedule -n open-cluster-management-backup
----

The `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource creates six `schedule.velero.io` resources, which are used to generate backups. Run the following command to view the list of the backups that are scheduled:

----
oc get schedules -A | grep acm
----

Resources are separately backed up in the groups as seen in the following table:

.Resource groups table
|===
| Resource | Description

| _Credentials backup_
| Backup file that stores Hive credentials, {product-title-short}, and user-created credentials and ConfigMaps.

| _Resources backup_
| Contains one backup for the {product-title-short} resources and one for generic resources. These resources use the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label.

| _Managed clusters backup_
| Contains only resources that activate the managed cluster connection to the hub cluster, where the backup is restored.
|===

*Note:* The _resources backup_ file contains managed cluster-specific resources, but does not contain the subset of resources that connect managed clusters to the hub cluster. The resources that connect managed clusters are called activation resources and are contained in the managed clusters backup. When you restore backups only for the _credentials_ and _resources_ backup on a new hub cluster, the new hub cluster shows all managed clusters that are created by using the Hive API in a detached state. The managed clusters that are imported on the primary hub cluster by using the import operation appear only when the activation data is restored on the passive hub cluster. The managed clusters are still connected to the original hub cluster that created the backup files.

When the activation data is restored, only managed clusters created by using the Hive API are automatically connected with the new hub cluster. All other managed clusters appear in a _Pending_ state. You need to manually reattach them to the new cluster.
