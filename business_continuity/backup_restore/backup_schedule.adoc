[#using-backup-restore]
= Scheduling and restoring backups

Complete the following steps to schedule and restore backups:

. Use the backup and restore operator, `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`, to create a backup schedule and use the `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resources to restore a backup.

. Run the following command to create a `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource:
+
----
oc create -f cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml
----
+
Your `cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml` resource might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: schedule-acm
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  veleroSchedule: 0 */2 * * * <1>
  veleroTtl: 120h <2>
----
+
<1> Create a backup every 2 hours
<2> *Optional:* Deletes scheduled backups after 120h. If not specified, the maximum Velero default value of 720h is used.
+
View the following descriptions of the `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` `spec` properties:
+
** `veleroSchedule` is a required property and defines a cron job for scheduling the backups.
** `veleroTtl` is an optional property and defines the expiration time for a scheduled backup resource. If not specified, the maximum default value set by Velero is used, which is `720h`.

. Check the status of your `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, which displays the definition for the three `schedule.velero.io` resources. Run the following command:
+
----
oc get BackupSchedule -n open-cluster-management-backup
----

. As a reminder, the restore operation is run on a different hub cluster for restore scenarios. To initiate a restore operation, create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource on the hub cluster where you want to restore backups.
+
*Note:* When you restore a backup on a new hub cluster, make sure that you shut down the previous hub cluster where the backup was created. If it is running, the previous hub cluster tries to reimport the managed clusters as soon as the managed cluster reconciliation finds that the managed clusters are no longer available.
+
You can use the cluster backup and restore operator, `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` and `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resources, to create a backup or restore resource. See the _cluster-backup-operator_ samples.
+
. Run the following command to create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource:
+
----
oc create -f cluster_v1beta1_backupschedule.yaml
----
+
Your resource might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupName: latest
----

. View the Velero `Restore` resource by running the following command:
+
----
oc get restore.velero.io -n open-cluster-management-backup
----

. View the {acm-short} `Restore` events by running the following command:
+
----
oc describe restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io -n open-cluster-management-backup
----

[#extend-backup-data]
== Extending backup data

You can backup third-party resources with cluster backup and restore by adding the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label to the resources. The value of the label can be any string, including an empty string. Use a value that can help you identify the component that you are backing up. For example, use the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: idp` label if the components are provided by an IDP solution.

*Note:* Use the `cluster-activation` value for the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label if you want the resources to be restored when the managed clusters activation resources are restored. Restoring the managed clusters activation resources result in managed clusters being actively managed by the hub cluster, where the restore was started.

[#schedule-backup]
== Scheduling a cluster backup

A backup schedule is activated when you create the `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource. View the following `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` sample:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: schedule-acm
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  veleroSchedule: 0 */2 * * *
  veleroTtl: 120h
----

After you create a `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, run the following command to get the status of the scheduled cluster backups:

----
oc get BackupSchedule -n open-cluster-management-backup
----

The `backupschedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource creates six `schedule.velero.io` resources, which are used to generate backups. Run the following command to view the list of the backups that are scheduled:

----
oc get schedules -A | grep acm
----

Resources are separately backed up in the groups as seen in the following table:

.Resource groups table
|===
| Resource | Description

| `Credentials` backup
| Backup file that stores Hive credentials, {acm-short}, and user-created credentials and ConfigMaps.

| `Resources` backup
| Contains one backup for the {acm-short} resources and one for generic resources. These resources use the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label.

| `ManagedClusters` backup
| Contains only resources that activate the managed cluster connection to the hub cluster, where the backup is restored.
|===

*Note:* The _resources backup_ file contains managed cluster-specific resources, but does not contain the subset of resources that connect managed clusters to the hub cluster. The resources that connect managed clusters are called activation resources and are contained in the managed clusters backup. When you restore backups only for the _credentials_ and _resources_ backup on a new hub cluster, the new hub cluster shows all managed clusters that are created by using the Hive API in a detached state. The managed clusters that are imported on the primary hub cluster by using the import operation appear only when the activation data is restored on the passive hub cluster. The managed clusters are still connected to the original hub cluster that created the backup files.

When the activation data is restored, only managed clusters created by using the Hive API are automatically connected with the new hub cluster. All other managed clusters appear in a _Pending_ state. You need to manually reattach them to the new cluster.

For descriptions of the various `BackupSchedule` statuses, see the following table:

.BackupSchedule status table
|===
| `BackupSchedule` status | Description

| `Enabled`
| The `BackupSchedule` is running and generating backups.

| `FailedValidation`
| An error prevents the `BackupSchedule` from running. As a result, the `BackupSchedule` is not generating backups, but instead, it is reconciling and waiting for the error to be fixed. Look at the `BackupSchedule` status section for the reason why the resource is not valid. After the error is addressed, the `BackupSchedule` status changes to `Enabled`, and the resource starts generating backups.

| `BackupCollision`
| The `BackupSchedule` is not generating backups. Look at the `BackupSchedule` status section for the reason why the resource status is `BackupCollision`. To start creating backups, delete this resource and create a new one.

[#avoid-backup-collision]
=== Avoiding backup collisions

Backup collisions might occur if the hub cluster changes status from passive to primary hub cluster, or from primary to passive, and different hub clusters back up data at the same storage location.

As a result, the latest backups are generated by a hub cluster that is no longer set as the primary hub cluster. This hub cluster still produces backups because the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource is still enabled.

See the following list to learn about two scenarios that might cause a backup collision:

. The primary hub cluster fails unexpectedly, which is caused by the following conditions:
- Communication from the primary hub cluster to Hub1 fails.
- The Hub1 backup data is restored on a secondary hub cluster, called Hub2.
- The administrator creates the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource on Hub2, which is now the primary hub cluster and generates backup data to the common storage location.
- Hub1 unexpectedly starts working again.
+
Since the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource is still enabled on Hub1, Hub1 resumes writing backups to the same storage location as Hub2. Both hub clusters are now writing backup data at the same storage location. Any hub cluster restoring the latest backups from this storage location might use Hub1 data instead of Hub2 data.

. The administrator tests a disaster scenario by making Hub2 a primary hub cluster, which is caused by the following conditions:
- Hub1 is stopped.
- Hub1 backup data is restored on Hub2.
- The administrator creates the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource on Hub2, which is now the primary hub cluster and generates backup data to the common storage location.
- After the disaster test is completed, the administrator reverts to the previous state and makes Hub1 the primary hub cluster again.
- Hub1 starts while Hub2 is still active.
+
Since the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource is still enabled on Hub2, it writes backups at the same storage location that corrupts the backup data. Any hub cluster restoring the latest backups from this location might use Hub2 data instead of Hub1 data. In this scenario, stopping Hub2 first or deleting the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource on Hub2 before starting Hub1 fixes the backup collision issue.

To avoid and report backup collisions, a `BackupCollision` state exists for the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource. The controller checks regularly if the latest backup in the storage location has been generated from the current hub cluster. If not, a different hub cluster has recently written backup data to the storage location, indicating that the hub cluster is colliding with a different hub cluster.

In this case, the current hub cluster `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource status is set to `BackupCollision` and the `Schedule.velero.io` resources created by this resource are deleted to avoid data corruption. The `BackupCollision` is reported by the backup policy. The administrator verifies which hub cluster writes to the storage location, before removing the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource from the invalid hub cluster and creating a new `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource on the valid primary hub cluster, to resume the backup.

Run the following command to check if there is a backup collision:

----
oc get backupschedule -A
----

If there is a backup collision, the output might resemble the following example:

----
NAMESPACE       NAME               PHASE             MESSAGE
openshift-adp   schedule-hub-1   BackupCollision   Backup acm-resources-schedule-20220301234625, from cluster with id [be97a9eb-60b8-4511-805c-298e7c0898b3] is using the same storage location. This is a backup collision with current cluster [1f30bfe5-0588-441c-889e-eaf0ae55f941] backup. Review and resolve the collision then create a new BackupSchedule resource to  resume backups from this cluster.
