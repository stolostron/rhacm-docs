[#dr4hub-install-backup-and-restore]
= Installing the backup and restore operator

The cluster backup and restore operator is not installed automatically. Continue reading to learn how to install and enable the operator.

*Notes:*

- Custom resource definitons are cluster-scoped, so you cannot have two different versions of OADP or Velero installed on the same cluster. If you have two different versions, one version runs with the wrong custom resource definitions.

- If you did not enable the cluster backup and restore operator on the `MultiClusterHub` resource, the OADP Operator and Velero custom resource definition are still installed on the hub cluster. The `MultiClusterHub` resource reconciles the OADP and Velero custom resource definitions with the version that is used by the OADP Operator, which is installed when you enabled the cluster backup and restore operator. As a result, you cannot install another version of OADP or Velero on the hub cluster, unless your version uses the same custom resource definitions as the OADP Operator that is installed when you enabled the backup and restore operator.

- The backup component works with the OADP Operator that is installed in the component namespace. 

- Before you can use the backup and restore operator, you must set up hub clusters. 

*Important:*

If you manually install the OADP operator, the custom resource definition version of the OADP operator and Velereo must exactly match. If these versions do not exactly match one another, you encounter problems. If you have previously installed and used the OADP Operator on the hub cluster in a namespace different from the backup component namespace, uninstall this version.

Velero is installed with the OADP Operator on the {acm} hub cluster. It is used to backup and restore {acm-short} hub cluster resources. 

For a list of supported storage providers for Velero, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/about-installing-oadp.html[About installing OADP].

To install and enable the operator, you must complete the following tasks:

[#setting-up-hub-clusters-for-backup-and-restore-operators]
== Setting up hub clusters for backup and restore operators 

To use the backup and restore operator, you must set up hub clusters. 

[#creating-the-storage-location-secret]
=== Creating the storage location secret 

To create a storage location secret, complete the following steps: 

. Complete the steps for link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/backup_and_restore/oadp-application-backup-and-restore#oadp-creating-default-secret_installing-oadp-aws[Creating a default Secret] for the cloud storage where the backups are saved. 
. Create the secret resource in the OADP Operator namespace, which is located in the backup component namespace.

[#enabling-the-backup-operator]
=== Enabling the backup operator 

Enable the backup operator to use the disaster recovery solutions for {acm}. 

[#enabling-backup-operator-prerequisite]
==== Prerequisite 

* From your {ocp} cluster, install the {acm-short} operator version {product-version}. The `MultiClusterHub` resource is automatically created when you install {acm-short}, and displays the following status: `Running`. 
[#enabling-backup-operator-clusters]

==== Enabling backup operators for your hub clusters 

To enable the backup operator for your active and passive hub clusters, complete the following steps:

. Enable the cluster backup and restore operator, `cluster-backup`, by completing the following steps: 
.. Update the `MultiClusterHub` resource by setting the `cluster-backup` parameter to `true`. If this hub cluster does not have the AWS Security Token Service (STS) option enabled, the OADP operator is also installed in the same namespace with the backup component. 
.. For hub clusters where the STS option is enabled, you must manually install the OADP operator. 
. Ensure that the restore hub cluster uses the same {acm-short} version that the backup hub cluster uses. You cannot restore a backup on a hub cluster with a version earlier than the one used by the backup hub cluster. 
. Manually configure the restore hub cluster by completing the following steps:
.. Install all operators that are installed on the active hub cluster and in the same namespace as the active hub cluster. 
.. Verify that the new hub cluster is configured the same way as the backup hub cluster.  
.. Use the same namespace name as the backup hub cluster when you install the backup and restore operator and any operators that are configured on the backup hub cluster. 
. Create the `DataProtectionApplication` resource on the passive hub cluster by completing the following steps: 
.. Create the `DataProtectionApplication` resource on both the active and passive hub cluster. 
.. For the restore hub cluster, when you create the `DataProtectionApplication` resource, use the same storage location as the backup hub. 

[#running-restore-operation]
==== Running a restore operation on a hub cluster with a newer version 

If you want to run the restore operation on a hub cluster that uses a newer {acm-short} version than the hub cluster where the backup was created, you can still run a restore operation by completing the following steps:

. On the restore hub cluster, install the operator at the same version as the hub cluster where the backup was created. 
. Restore the backup data on the restore hub cluster. 
. On the restore hub cluster, use the upgrade operation to upgrade to the version you want to use. 

[#creating-a-dataprotectionapplication-resource]
=== Creating a `DataProtectionApplication` resource 

To create an instance of the `DataProtectionApplication` resource for your active and passive hub clusters, complete the following steps: 

. From the {ocp} console, select *Operators* > *Installed Operators*.
. Click `Create instance` under DataProtectionApplication.
. Create the Velero instance by selecting configurations using the {ocp-short) console or by using a YAML file as mentioned in the `DataProtectionApplication` example.
. Set the `DataProtectionApplication` namespace to `open-cluster-management-backup`.
. Set the specification (`spec:`) values appropriately for the `DataProtectionApplication` resource. Then click *Create*.
+
If you intend on using the default backup storage location, set the following value, `default: true` in the `backupStorageLocations` section. View the following `DataProtectionApplication` resource sample:
+
[source,yaml]

[#enabling-the-backup-and-restore-component-in-a-disconnected-environment]
=== Enabling the backup and restore component in a disconnected environment 

To enable the backup and restore component with {ocp} in a disconnected environment, complete the following steps: 

. Update the `MultiClusterHub` resource with the follwing annotation to override the source from which the OADP operator is installed. Create the annotation before the `cluster-backup` component is enabled on the `MultiClusterHub` resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  annotations:
    installer.open-cluster-management.io/oadp-subscription-spec: '{"source": "redhat-operator-index"}'
----
+
. The `redhat-operator-index` is a custom name and represents the name of the `CatalogSource` resource that you define and use to access Red Hat OpenShift Operators in the disconnected environment. Run the following command to retrieve the `catalogsource`:
+
----
oc get catalogsource -A
----
+
The output might resemble the following:

[#enabling-backup-restore]
== Enabling the backup and restore operator

The cluster backup and restore operator can be enabled when the `MultiClusterHub` resource is created for the first time. The `cluster-backup` parameter is set to `true`. When the operator is enabled, the operator resources are installed.

If the `MultiClusterHub` resource is already created, you can install or uninstall the cluster backup operator by editing the `MultiClusterHub` resource. Set `cluster-backup` to `false`, if you want to uninstall the cluster backup operator.

When the backup and restore operator is enabled, your `MultiClusterHub` resource might resemble the following YAML file:

[source,yaml]
