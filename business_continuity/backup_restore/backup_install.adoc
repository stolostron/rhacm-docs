[#setting-up-hub-clusters-for-backup-and-restore-operators]
== Setting up hub clusters for backup and restore operators 

To use the backup and restore operator, you must set up hub clusters. To set up hub clusters, complete the following sections in order: 

* <<creating-the-storage-location-secret,Creating the storage location secret>>
* <<enabling-the-backup-operator,Enabling the backup operator>>
* <<installing-the-oadp-operator,Installing the OADP operator>>
* <<creating-a-dataprotectionapplication-resource,Creating a `DataProtectionApplication` resource>>
* <<enabling-the-backup-and-restore-component-in-a-disconnected-environment,Enabling the backup and restore component in a disconnected environment>>

[#creating-the-storage-location-secret]
=== Creating the storage location secret 

To create a storage location secret, complete the following steps: 

. Complete the steps for link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/backup_and_restore/oadp-application-backup-and-restore#oadp-creating-default-secret_installing-oadp-aws[Creating a default Secret] for the cloud storage where the backups are saved. 
. Create the secret resource in the OADP Operator namespace, which is located in the backup component namespace.

[#enabling-the-backup-operator]
=== Enabling the backup operator 

To enable backup operator for your active and passive hub clusters, complete the following steps:

. From your {ocp} cluster, install the {product-title} operator version {product-version}.x. The `MultiClusterHub` resource is automatically created when you install {product-title-short}, and displays the following status: `Running`.
. Manually install the cluster backup and restore operator. Enable the cluster backup and restore operator (`cluster-backup`). Edit the `MultiClusterHub` resource by setting the `cluster-backup` parameter to `true`. If this hub cluster does not have the AWS Security Token Service (STS) option enabled, the OADP operator is also installed in the same namespace with the backup component. For hub clusters where the STS option is enabled, you must manually install the OADP operator. 
. Before you run the restore operation on the passive hub cluster, complete the following steps:
.. Ensure that the passive hub cluster uses the same {product-title-short} version or newer that the backup hub cluster uses. 
.. Manually configure the hub cluster and install all operators on the active hub cluster and in the same namespace as the active hub cluster. 
.. Verify that other operators, like: {aap-short}, {ocp} GitOps, or certificate manager, are installed. By verifying, you ensure that the new hub cluster is configured the same way as the initial hub cluster.
.. Ensure that the passive hub cluster uses the same namespace name as the initial hub cluster when you install the backup and restore operator and any operators that are configured on the previous hub cluster. 
. Create the `DataProtectionApplication resource` on the passive hub cluster. 
. Connect the passive hub cluster to the same storage location where the initial hub cluster backed up the data.

[#installing-the-oadp-operator]
=== Installing the OADP operator 

For hub clusters where you enabled the AWS Security Token Service (STS) option, the OADP operator is not installed when you installed the cluster backup and restore operator on the hub cluster. To pass the STS `role_arn` to the OADP operator, you must manually install the OADP operator. 

For hub clusters where you did not enable the STS option, the OADP operator is automatically installed when you install the cluster backup and restore operator on the hub cluster. 

When you enable the backup option from the `MultiClusterHub` resource, the backup option remains in the `Pending` state until you install the OADP operator in the `open-cluster-management-backup` namespace. If you have not enabled the AWS STS option on your hub cluster, then the OADP operator is automatically installed with the backup chart. Otherwise, you must manually install the OADP operator.

When the cluster is in the STS mode, the backup chart creates a config map named `acm-redhat-oadp-operator-subscription` in the `open-cluster-management-backup` namespace. This config map also contains the OADP channel and environment information. Use this config map to get the OADP version that you need to install and to get any environment options to be set on the OADP subscription.

To learn more about installing the OADP operator with the STS option, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_backing_up_and_restoring_applications/backing-up-applications.html[Installing OADP on ROSA with STS]. 

*Notes:*

- Custom resource definitons are cluster-scoped, so you cannot have two different versions of OADP or Velero installed on the same cluster. If you have two different versions, one version runs with the wrong custom resource definitions.

- When you create the `MultiClusterHub` resource, the Velero custom resource definitions (CRDs) do not automatically install on the hub cluster. When you install the OADP operator, the Velero CRDs are installed on the hub cluster. As a result, the Velero CRD resources are no longer reconciled and updated by the `MultiClusterHub` resource. 

- The backup component works with the OADP Operator that is installed in the component namespace. 

*Important:*

If you manually install the OADP operator, the custom resource definition version of the OADP operator and Velereo must exactly match. If these versions do not exactly match one another, you encounter problems. 

Velero is installed with the OADP Operator on the {product-title} hub cluster. It is used to backup and restore {product-title-short} hub cluster resources. 

For a list of supported storage providers for Velero, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/about-installing-oadp.html[About installing OADP].

[#creating-a-dataprotectionapplication-resource]
=== Creating a `DataProtectionApplication` resource 

To create an instance of the `DataProtectionApplication` resource for your active and passive hub clusters, complete the following steps: 

. From the {ocp} console, select *Operators* > *Installed Operators*.
. Click `Create instance` under DataProtectionApplication.
. Create the Velero instance by selecting configurations using the {ocp-short) console or by using a YAML file as mentioned in the `DataProtectionApplication` example.
. Set the `DataProtectionApplication` namespace to `open-cluster-management-backup`.
. Set the specification (`spec:`) values appropriately for the `DataProtectionApplication` resource. Then click *Create*.
+
If you intend on using the default backup storage location, set the following value, `default: true` in the `backupStorageLocations` section. View the following `DataProtectionApplication` resource sample:
+
[source,yaml]

[#enabling-the-backup-and-restore-component-in-a-disconnected-environment]
=== Enabling the backup and restore component in a disconnected environment 

To enable the backup and restore component with {ocp} in a disconnected environment, complete the following steps: 

. Update the `MultiClusterHub` resource with the follwing annotation to override the source from which the OADP operator is installed. Create the annotation before the `cluster-backup` component is enabled on the `MultiClusterHub` resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  annotations:
    installer.open-cluster-management.io/oadp-subscription-spec: '{"source": "redhat-operator-index"}'
----
+
. The `redhat-operator-index` is a custom name and represents the name of the `CatalogSource` resource that you define and use to access Red Hat OpenShift Operators in the disconnected environment. Run the following command to retrieve the `catalogsource`:
+
----
oc get catalogsource -A
----
+
The output might resemble the following:

[#enabling-backup-restore]
== Enabling the backup and restore operator

The cluster backup and restore operator can be enabled when the `MultiClusterHub` resource is created for the first time. The `cluster-backup` parameter is set to `true`. When the operator is enabled, the operator resources are installed.

If the `MultiClusterHub` resource is already created, you can install or uninstall the cluster backup operator by editing the `MultiClusterHub` resource. Set `cluster-backup` to `false`, if you want to uninstall the cluster backup operator.

When the backup and restore operator is enabled, your `MultiClusterHub` resource might resemble the following YAML file:
