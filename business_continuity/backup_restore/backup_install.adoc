[#setting-up-hub-clusters-for-backup-and-restore-operators]
== Setting up hub clusters for backup and restore operators 

To use the backup and restore operator, you must set up hub clusters. To set up hub clusters, complete the following sections in order: 

* <<creating-the-storage-location-secret,Creating the storage location secret>>
* <<enabling-the-backup-operator,Enabling the backup operator>>
* <<installing-the-oadp-operator,Installing the OADP operator>>
* <<creating-a-dataprotectionapplication-resource,Creating a `DataProtectionApplication` resource>>
* <<enabling-the-backup-and-restore-component-in-a-disconnected-environment,Enabling the backup and restore component in a disconnected environment>>

[#creating-the-storage-location-secret]
=== Creating the storage location secret 

To create a storage location secret, complete the following steps: 

. Complete the steps for link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/backup_and_restore/oadp-application-backup-and-restore#oadp-creating-default-secret_installing-oadp-aws[Creating a default Secret] for the cloud storage where the backups are saved. 
. Create the secret resource in the OADP Operator namespace, which is located in the backup component namespace.

[#enabling-the-backup-operator]
=== Enabling the backup operator 

To enable backup operator for your active and passive hub clusters, complete the following steps:

. From your {ocp} cluster, install the {acm} operator version {product-version}.x. The `MultiClusterHub` resource is automatically created when you install {acm-short}, and displays the following status: `Running`.
. Manually install the cluster backup and restore operator. 
. Enable the cluster backup and restore operator (`cluster-backup`). 
. Edit the `MultiClusterHub` resource by setting the `cluster-backup` parameter to `true`. If this hub cluster does not have the AWS Security Token Service (STS) option enabled, the OADP operator is also installed in the same namespace with the backup component. For hub clusters where the STS option is enabled, you must manually install the OADP operator. 
. Ensure that the restore hub cluster uses the same {acm-short} version that the backup hub cluster uses. You cannot restore a backup on a hub cluster with a version earlier than the one used by the backup hub cluster. 
. *Optional:* If you want to run the restore operation on a hub cluster that has a version newer than the hub cluster where the backup was created, complete the following:
.. On the restore hub cluster, install the operator at the same version as the hub cluster where the backup was created. 
.. Restore the date on the restore hub cluster. 
.. On the restore hub cluster, use the upgrade operation to upgrade to the version you want to use. 
.. Manually configure the hub cluster.
.. Install all operators on the active hub cluster and in the same namespace as the active hub cluster. 
.. Verify that other operators, such as {aap-short}, {ocp-short} GitOps, or certificate manager, are installed. 
.. Verify that the new hub cluster is configured the same way as the initial hub cluster.
.. Use the same namespace name as the initial hub cluster when you install the backup and restore operator and any operators that are configured on the earlier hub cluster. 
. Create the `DataProtectionApplication resource` on the passive hub cluster. 
. Connect the passive hub cluster to the same storage location where the initial hub cluster backed up the data.

[#installing-the-oadp-operator]
=== Installing the OADP operator 

For hub clusters where you enabled the AWS Security Token Service (STS) option, the OADP operator is not installed when you installed the cluster backup and restore operator on the hub cluster. To pass the STS `role_arn` to the OADP operator, you must manually install the OADP operator. 

For hub clusters where you did not enable the STS option, the OADP operator is automatically installed when you install the cluster backup and restore operator on the hub cluster. 

When you enable the backup option from the `MultiClusterHub` resource, the backup option remains in the `Pending` state until you install the OADP operator in the `open-cluster-management-backup` namespace. If you have not enabled the AWS STS option on your hub cluster, then the OADP operator is automatically installed with the backup chart. Otherwise, you must manually install the OADP operator.

When the cluster is in the STS mode, the backup chart creates a config map named `acm-redhat-oadp-operator-subscription` in the `open-cluster-management-backup` namespace. This config map also contains the OADP channel and environment information. Use this config map to get the OADP version that you need to install and to get any environment options to be set on the OADP subscription.

To learn more about installing the OADP operator with the STS option, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_backing_up_and_restoring_applications/backing-up-applications.html[Installing OADP on ROSA with STS]. 

*Important:*

When you install the OADP operator, see the following notes: 

- Custom resource definitons are cluster-scoped, so you cannot have two different versions of OADP or Velero installed on the same cluster. If you have two different versions, one version runs with the wrong custom resource definitions.

- When you create the `MultiClusterHub` resource, the Velero custom resource definitions (CRDs) do not automatically install on the hub cluster. When you install the OADP operator, the Velero CRDs are installed on the hub cluster. As a result, the Velero CRD resources are no longer reconciled and updated by the `MultiClusterHub` resource. 

- The backup component works with the OADP Operator that is installed in the component namespace. 

- If you manually install the OADP operator, the custom resource definition version of the OADP operator and Velereo must exactly match. If these versions do not exactly match one another, you get problems. 

- Velero is installed with the OADP Operator on the {acm} hub cluster. It is used to backup and restore {acm-short} hub cluster resources. 

- For a list of supported storage providers for Velero, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/about-installing-oadp.html[About installing OADP].

[#installing-custom-oadp]
=== Installing a custom OADP version 

Setting an annotation on your `MultiClusterHub` resource allows you to customize the OADP version for your specific needs. Complete the following steps:

. To override the OADP version installed by the backup and restore operator, use the following annotation on the `MultiClusterHub` resource:

+
[source,yaml]
----
installer.open-cluster-management.io/oadp-subscription-spec: '{"channel": "stable-1.4"}'
----
*Important:* If you use this option to get a different OADP version than the one installed by default by the backup and restore operator, make sure this version is supported on the {ocp} version used by the hub cluster. Use this override option with caution because it can result in unsupported configurations.

. For example, install the OADP 1.5 version by setting your annotation. Your `MultiClusterHub` resource might resemble the following example: 

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  annotations:
    installer.open-cluster-management.io/oadp-subscription-spec: '{"channel": "stable-1.5","installPlanApproval": "Automatic","name":
      "redhat-oadp-operator","source": "redhat-operators","sourceNamespace": "openshift-marketplace"}'
  name: multiclusterhub
spec: {}
---- 

. Enable the `cluster-backup` option on the `MultiClusterHub` resource by setting `cluster-back` to `true`. 

[#creating-a-dataprotectionapplication-resource]
=== Creating a `DataProtectionApplication` resource 

To create an instance of the `DataProtectionApplication` resource for your active and passive hub clusters, complete the following steps: 

. From the {ocp} console, select *Operators* > *Installed Operators*.
. Click `Create instance` under DataProtectionApplication.
. Create the Velero instance by selecting configurations using the {ocp-short} console or by using a YAML file as mentioned in the `DataProtectionApplication` example.
. Set the `DataProtectionApplication` namespace to `open-cluster-management-backup`.
. Set the specification (`spec:`) values appropriately for the `DataProtectionApplication` resource. Then click *Create*.

+
If you intend on using the default backup storage location, set the following value, `default: true` in the `backupStorageLocations` section. View the following `DataProtectionApplication` resource sample:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: dpa-sample
spec:
  configuration:
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - openshift
      - aws
    restic:
      enable: true
  backupLocations:
    - name: default
      velero:
        provider: aws
        default: true
        objectStorage:

          prefix: my-prefix
        config:
          region: us-east-1
          profile: "default"
        credential:

[#enabling-the-backup-and-restore-component-in-a-disconnected-environment]
=== Enabling the backup and restore component in a disconnected environment 

To enable the backup and restore component with {ocp} in a disconnected environment, complete the following steps: 

. Update the `MultiClusterHub` resource with the follwing annotation to override the source from which the OADP operator is installed. Create the annotation before the `cluster-backup` component is enabled on the `MultiClusterHub` resource:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  annotations:
    installer.open-cluster-management.io/oadp-subscription-spec: '{"source": "redhat-operator-index"}'
----

. The `redhat-operator-index` is a custom name and represents the name of the `CatalogSource` resource that you define and use to access Red Hat OpenShift Operators in the disconnected environment. Run the following command to retrieve the `catalogsource`:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get catalogsource -A
----
+
The output might resemble the following:

+
[source,bash]
----
NAMESPACE               NAME                         DISPLAY                       TYPE   PUBLISHER   AGE
openshift-marketplace   acm-custom-registry          Advanced Cluster Management   grpc   Red Hat     42h

[#enabling-backup-restore]
== Enabling the backup and restore operator

The cluster backup and restore operator can be enabled when the `MultiClusterHub` resource is created for the first time. The `cluster-backup` parameter is set to `true`. When the operator is enabled, the operator resources are installed.

If the `MultiClusterHub` resource is already created, you can install or uninstall the cluster backup operator by editing the `MultiClusterHub` resource. Set `cluster-backup` to `false`, if you want to uninstall the cluster backup operator.

When the backup and restore operator is enabled, your `MultiClusterHub` resource might resemble the following YAML file:
