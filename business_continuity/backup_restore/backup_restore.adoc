[#restore-backup]
= Restoring a backup

In a typical restore scenario, the hub cluster where the backups run becomes unavailable, and the backed up data needs to be moved to a new hub cluster. This is done by running the cluster restore operation on the new hub cluster. In this case, the restore operation runs on a different hub cluster than where the backup is created.

There are also cases where you want to restore the data on the same hub cluster where the backup was collected so that you can recover the data from a previous snapshot. In this case, both restore and backup operations run on the same hub cluster.

After you create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource on the hub cluster, you can run the following command to get the status of the restore operation: 

----
oc get restore -n open-cluster-management-backup
----

You can also verify that the backed up resources that are contained by the backup file are created.

*Note:* The `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource runs once unless you use the `syncRestoreWithNewBackups` option and set it to `true`, as mentioned in the <<restore-passive-resources,Restore passive resources>> section. If you want to run the same restore operation again after the restore operation is complete, you must create a new `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource with the same `spec` options.

The restore operation is used to restore all 3 backup types that are created by the backup operation. You can choose to install only a certain type of backup, such as only managed clusters, only user credentials, or only hub cluster resources.

The restore defines the following 3 required `spec` properties, where the restore logic is defined for the types of backed up files:

* `veleroManagedClustersBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the managed clusters activation resources.
* `veleroCredentialsBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the user credentials.
* `veleroResourcesBackupName` is used to define the restore option for the hub cluster resources (`Applications`, `Policy`, and other hub cluster resources like managed cluster passive data).
+
The valid options for the previously mentioned properties are following values:
+
** `latest` - This property restores the last available backup file for this type of backup.
** `skip` - This property does not attempt to restore this type of backup with the current restore operation.
** `<backup_name>` - This property restores the specified backup pointing to it by name. 

The name of the `restore.velero.io` resources that are created by the `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` is generated using the following template rule, `<restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io name>-<velero-backup-resource-name>`. View the following descriptions:

* `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io name` is the name of the current `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, which initiates the restore.
* `velero-backup-resource-name` is the name of the Velero backup file that is used for restoring the data. For example, the `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource named `restore-acm` creates `restore.velero.io` restore resources. View the following examples for the format:

** `restore-acm-acm-managed-clusters-schedule-20210902205438` is used for restoring managed cluster activation data backups. In this sample, the `backup.velero.io` backup name used to restore the resource is `acm-managed-clusters-schedule-20210902205438`.
** `restore-acm-acm-credentials-schedule-20210902206789` is used for restoring credential backups. In this sample, the `backup.velero.io` backup name used to restore the resource is `acm-managed-clusters-schedule-20210902206789`.
** `restore-acm-acm-resources-schedule-20210902201234` is used for restoring application, policy, and other hub cluster resources like managed cluster passive data backups. In this sample, the `backup.velero.io` backup name used to restore the resource is `acm-managed-clusters-schedule-20210902201234`.

*Note:* If `skip` is used for a backup type, `restore.velero.io` is not created.

View the following YAML sample of the cluster `Restore` resource. In this sample, all three types of backed up files are being restored, using the latest available backed up files:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupName: latest
----

*Note:* Only managed clusters created by the Hive API are automatically connected with the new hub cluster when the `acm-managed-clusters` backup from the managed clusters backup is restored on another hub cluster. All other managed clusters remain in the `Pending Import` state and must be imported back onto the new hub cluster. For more information, see <<restore-imported-managed-clusters,Restoring imported managed clusters>>.

[#restoring-data-primary-hub]
== Restoring data back to the initial primary hub 

When you need to restore backup data on a cluster, create a new cluster instead of using the primary hub cluster or a hub cluster where user resources were created before the restore operation. During the hub cluster restore operation, you can configure the hub cluster backup restore to clean up the existing resources, if these resources are not part of the backup data being restored. The restore cleans up resources created by an earlier backup but does not clean up user resources. As a result, resources created by the user on this hub cluster are not cleaned up, so the data on this hub cluster is not reflective of the data available with the restored resource.

A disaster recovery test, where you only validate the restore operation on a passive hub, then move back to use the primary hub cluster, is one situation where you can use the primary hub cluster as the passive cluster. In this recovery test scenario, you are only testing the hub backup scenario. You do not use the primary hub cluster to create new resources. Instead, the backup data has temporarily moved from the primary hub cluster to the passive hub cluster. You can make the initial primary hub cluster a primary hub cluster again if you restore all resources to this hub cluster. The operation runs the post restore operation, which moves the managed clusters back to this hub cluster. 

[#prepare-new-hub]
== Preparing the new hub cluster 

Before running the restore operation on a new hub cluster, you need to manually configure the hub cluster and install the same operators as on the initial hub cluster. You must install the {acm-short} operator in the same namespace as the initial hub cluster, create the _DataProtectionApplication_ resource, and then connect to the same storage location where the initial hub cluster previously backed up data.

Use the same configuration as on the initial hub cluster for the `MultiClusterHub` resource created by the {acm-short} operator, including any changes to the `MultiClusterEngine` resource.

For example, if the initial hub cluster has any other operators installed, such as {aap-short}, {gitops}, `cert-manager`, you have to install them before running the restore operation. This ensures that the new hub cluster is configured in the same way as the initial hub cluster.

[#clean-hub-restore]
== Cleaning the hub cluster after restore

Velero updates existing resources if they have changed with the currently restored backup. Velero does not clean up delta resources, which are resources created by a previous restore and not part of the currently restored backup. This limits the scenarios you can use when restoring hub cluster data on a new hub cluster. Unless the restore is applied only once, you cannot reliably use the new hub cluster as a passive configuration. The data on the hub cluster does not reflect the data available with the restored resources.

To address this limitation, when a `Restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource is created, the backup operator runs a post restore operation that cleans up the hub cluster. The operation removes any resources created by a previous {acm-short} restore that are not part of the currently restored backup.

The post restore cleanup uses the `cleanupBeforeRestore` property to identify the subset of objects to clean up. You can use the following options for the post restore cleanup:

- `None`: No clean up necessary, just begin Velero restore. Use `None` on a brand new hub cluster.
- `CleanupRestored`: Clean up all resources created by a previous {acm-short} restore that are not part of the currently restored backup.
- `CleanupAll`: Clean up all resources on the hub cluster that might be part of a {acm-short} backup, even if they were not created as a result of a restore operation. This is to be used when extra content is created on a hub cluster before the restore operation starts.
+
*Best Practice:* Avoid using the `CleanupAll` option. Only use it as a last resort with extreme caution. `CleanupAll` also cleans up resources on the hub cluster created by the user, in addition to resources created by a previously restored backup. Instead, use the `CleanupRestored` option to prevent updating the hub cluster content when the hub cluster is designated as a passive candidate for a disaster scenario. Use a clean hub cluster as a passive cluster.

*Notes:*

* Velero sets the status, `PartiallyFailed`, for a velero restore resource if the restored backup has no resources. This means that a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource can be in `PartiallyFailed` status if any of the created `restore.velero.io` resources do not restore any resources because the corresponding backup is empty.

* The `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource is run once, unless you use the `syncRestoreWithNewBackups:true` to keep restoring passive data when new backups are available. For this case, follow the restore passive with sync sample. See <<restore-passive-resources-check-backups,Restoring passive resources while checking for backups>>. After the restore operation is complete and you want to run another restore operation on the same hub cluster, you have to create a new `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource.

* Although you can create multiple `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resources, only one can be active at any moment in time.


[#restore-passive-resources-check-backups]
== Restoring passive resources while checking for backups

Use the `restore-passive-sync` sample to restore passive data, while continuing to check if new backups are available and restore them automatically. To automatically restore new backups, you must set the `syncRestoreWithNewBackups` parameter to `true`. You must also only restore the latest passive data. You can find the sample example at the end of this section.

Set the `VeleroResourcesBackupName` and `VeleroCredentialsBackupName` parameters to `latest`, and the `VeleroManagedClustersBackupName` parameter to `skip`. Immediately after the `VeleroManagedClustersBackupName` is set to `latest`, the managed clusters are activated on the new hub cluster and is now the primary hub cluster. 

When the activated managed cluster becomes the primary hub cluster, the restore resource is set to `Finished` and the `syncRestoreWithNewBackups` is ignored, even if set to `true`. 

By default, the controler checks for new backups every 30 minutes when the `syncRestoreWithNewBackups` is set to `true`. If new backups are found, it restores the backed up resources. You can change the duration of the check by updating the `restoreSyncInterval` parameter.

For example, see the following resource that checks for backups every 10 minutes:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm-passive-sync
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  syncRestoreWithNewBackups: true # restore again when new backups are available
  restoreSyncInterval: 10m # check for new backups every 10 minutes
  cleanupBeforeRestore: CleanupRestored 
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: skip
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupName: latest
----

[#restore-passive-resources]
== Restoring passive resources

Use the `restore-acm-passive` sample to restore hub cluster resources in a passive configuration. Passive data is backup data such as secrets, ConfigMaps, applications, policies, and all the managed cluster custom resources, which do not activate a connection between managed clusters and hub clusters. The backup resources are restored on the hub cluster by the credentials backup and restore resources.

See the following sample:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm-passive
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  cleanupBeforeRestore: CleanupRestored
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: skip
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupName: latest
----

[#restore-activation-resources]
== Restoring activation resources

Before you restore the activation data on the passive hub cluster, shut down the previous hub cluster where the backup was created. If the primary hub cluster is still running, it attempts to reconnect with the managed clusters that are no longer available, based on the reconciliation procedure running on this hub cluster.

Use the `restore-acm-passive-activate` sample when you want the hub cluster to manage the clusters. In this case it is assumed that the other data has been restored already on the hub cluster that using the passive resource.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm-passive-activate
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  cleanupBeforeRestore: CleanupRestored
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: skip
  veleroResourcesBackupName: skip
----

You have some options to restore activation resources, depending on how you restored the passive resources:

- If you used the `restore-acm-passive-sync cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource as documented in the _Restore passive resources while checking for backups to restore passive data_ section, update the `veleroManagedClustersBackupName` value to `latest` on this resource. As a result, the managed cluster resources and the `restore-acm-passive-sync` resource are restored.

- If you restored the passive resources as a one time operation, or did not restore any resources yet, choose to restore all resources as specified in the _Restoring all resources_ section.

[#managed-cluster-activation-data]
== Restoring managed cluster activation data

Managed cluster activation data or other activation data resources are stored by the managed clusters backup and by the resource-generic backups, when you use the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: cluster-activation` label. When the activation data is restored on a new hub cluster, managed clusters are being actively managed by the hub cluster where the restore is run. See _Scheduling and restoring backups_ to learn how you can use the operator.

[#restore-all-resources]
== Restoring all resources

Use the `restore-acm` sample if you want to restore all data at once and make the hub cluster manage the managed clusters in one step. After you create a `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource on the hub cluster, run the following command to get the status of the restore operation:

----
oc get restore -n open-cluster-management-backup
----

Your sample might resemble the following resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-acm
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  cleanupBeforeRestore: CleanupRestored
  veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
  veleroCredentialsBackupName: latest
  veleroResourcesBackupName: latest
----

From your hub cluster, verify that the backed up resources contained by the backup file are created.

[#restore-imported-managed-clusters]
== Restoring imported managed clusters

Only managed clusters connected with the primary hub cluster using the Hive API are automatically connected with the new hub cluster, where the activation data is restored. These clusters have been created on the primary hub cluster by the Hive API, using the *Create cluster* button in the *Clusters* tab or through the CLI. Managed clusters connected with the initial hub cluster using the *Import cluster* button appear as `Pending Import` when the activation data is restored, and must be imported back on the new hub cluster.

The Hive managed clusters can be connected with the new hub cluster because Hive stores the managed cluster `kubeconfig` in the managed cluster namespace on the hub cluster. This is backed up and restored on the new hub cluster. The import controller then updates the bootstrap `kubeconfig` on the managed cluster using the restored configuration, which is only available for managed clusters created using the Hive API. It is not available for imported clusters.

To reconnect imported clusters on the new hub cluster, manually create the `auto-import-secret` resource after your start the restore operation. See _Importing the cluster with the auto import secret_ for more details.

Create the `auto-import-secret` resource in the managed cluster namespace for each cluster in `Pending Import` state. Use a `kubeconfig` or token with enough permissions for the import component to start the automatic import on the new hub cluster. You must have access for each managed cluster by using a token to connect with the managed cluster. The token must have a `klusterlet` role binding or a role with the same permissions.
