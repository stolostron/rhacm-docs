[#backup-validation-using-a-policy]
= Validating your backup or restore configurations

The cluster backup and restore operator Helm chart, `cluster-backup-chart`, installs the `backup-restore-enabled` policy on your hub cluster, which is used to inform you about issues with the backup and restore component. 

*Note:* A hub cluster is automatically imported and managed by itself using the `local-cluster` managed cluster. If you disable this by setting `disableHubSelfManagement=true` on the `MultiClusterHub` resource, the `backup-restore-enabled` policy is not placed on the hub cluster and the policy templates do not produce any reports.

The `backup-restore-enabled` policy includes a set of templates that check for the following constraints:

- *Pod validation*
+
The following templates check the pod status for the backup component and dependencies:
+
** `acm-backup-pod-running` template checks if the backup and restore operator pod is running.
** `oadp-pod-running` template checks if the OADP operator pod is running. 
** `velero-pod-running` template checks if the Velero pod is running.

- *Data Protection Application validation*
+
* `data-protection-application-available` template checks if a `DataProtectioApplicatio.oadp.openshift.io` resource is created. This OADP resource sets up Velero configurations.

- *Backup storage validation*
+
* `backup-storage-location-available` template checks if a `BackupStorageLocation.velero.io` resource is created and if the status value is `Available`. This implies that the connection to the backup storage is valid. 

- *BackupSchedule collision validation*
+
* `acm-backup-clusters-collision-report` template verifies that the status is not `BackupCollision`, if a `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` exists on the current hub cluster. This verifies that the current hub cluster is not in collision with any other hub cluster when you write backup data to the storage location.
+
For a definition of the `BackupCollision`, see xref:../backup_restore/backup_schedule.adoc#avoid-backup-collision[Avoiding backup collisions].

- *BackupSchedule and restore status validation*
+
* `acm-backup-phase-validation` template checks that the status is not in `Failed`, or `Empty` state, if a `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` exists on the current cluster. This ensures that if this cluster is the primary hub cluster and is generating backups, the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` status is healthy.
* The same template checks that the status is not in a `Failed`, or `Empty` state, if a `Restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` exists on the current cluster. This ensures that if this cluster is the secondary hub cluster and is restoring backups, the `Restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` status is healthy.

- *Backups exist validation*
+
* `acm-managed-clusters-schedule-backups-available` template checks if `Backup.velero.io` resources are available at the location specified by the `BackupStorageLocation.velero.io`, and if the backups are created by a `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource. This validates that the backups have been run at least once, using the backup and restore operator.

- *Backups for completion*
+
* An `acm-backup-in-progress-report` template checks if `Backup.velero.io` resources are stuck in the `InProgress` state. This validation is added because with a large number of resources, the velero pod restarts as the backup runs, and the backup stays in progress without proceeding to completion. During a normal backup, the backup resources are in progress at some point when it is run, but are not stuck and run to completion. It is normal to see the `acm-backup-in-progress-report` template report a warning during the time the schedule is running and backups are in progress.

- *Backup schedules generate backups on the primary hub cluster*
+
* The `backup-schedule-cron-enabled` policy template notifies the hub cluster administrator that the primary hub cluster is not creating new backups. The policy shows that the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource is disabled on the primary hub cluster or is not able to create scheduled backups.
+
* The `backup-schedule-cron-enabled` policy template is in violation if the backup schedule on the primary hub cluster did not generate new backups when the `BackupSchedule` cron job definition expects new backups. This might happen if the `BackupSchedule` does not exist, is paused, or the `BackupSchedule` cron job property updated and the time to run the backups increased. The template is in violation until a new set of backups is created.
+
* The template validation works in the following ways:
+
** A `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` actively runs and saves new backups at the storage location. The `backup-schedule-cron-enabled` policy template completes this validation. The template checks that there is a `Backup.velero.io` with a `velero.io/schedule-name: acm-validation-policy-schedule` label at the storage location.
+
** The `acm-validation-policy-schedule` backups are set to expire after you set a time for the backups cron schedule. If no cron job is running to create backups, the old `acm-validation-policy-schedule` backup is deleted because it expired and a new one is not created. As a result, if no `acm-validation-policy-schedule` backups exists, there are no active cron jobs generating backups.

[#protecting-data-using-server-side-encryption]
== Protecting data using server-side encryption

Server-side encryption is data encryption for the application or service that receives the data at the storage location. The backup mechanism itself does not encrypt data while in-transit (as it travels to and from backup storage location), or at rest (while it is stored on disks at backup storage location). Instead it relies on the native mechanisms in the object and snapshot systems.

**Best practice**: Encrypt the data at the destination using the available backup storage server-side encryption. The backup contains resources, such as credentials and configuration files that need to be encrypted when stored outside of the hub cluster.

You can use `serverSideEncryption` and `kmsKeyId` parameters to enable encryption for the backups stored in Amazon S3. For more details, see the _Backup Storage Location YAML_. The following sample specifies an AWS KMS key ID when setting up the `DataProtectionApplication` resource:

[source,yaml]

          profile: default
