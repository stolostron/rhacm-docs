[#dr4hub-config]
= Configuring active-passive hub cluster

Learn how to configure an active-passive hub cluster configuration, where the initial hub cluster backs up data and one or more passive hub clusters are on stand-by to control the managed clusters when the active cluster becomes unavailable. 

[#active-passive-config]
== Active-passive configuration

In an active-passive configuration, there is one active hub cluster and passive hub clusters. An active hub cluster is also considered the primary hub cluster, which manages clusters and backs up resources at defined time intervals, using the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource. 

*Note:* To backup the primary hub cluster data, you do not need an `active-passive` configuration. You can simply backup and store the hub cluster data. This way, if there is an issue or failure, you can deploy a new hub cluster and restore your primary hub cluster data on this new hub cluster. To reduce the time to recover the primary hub cluster data, you can use an `active-passive` configuration; however, this is not necessary.                                                     

Passive hub clusters continuously retrieve the latest backups and restore the passive data. Passive hubs use the `Restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource to restore passive data from the primary hub cluster when new backup data is available. These hub clusters are on standby to become a primary hub when the primary hub cluster fails.

Active and passive hub clusters are connected to the same storage location, where the primary hub cluster backs up data for passive hub clusters to access the primary hub cluster backups. For more details on how to set up this automatic restore configuration, see _Restoring passive resources while checking for backups_.

In the following diagram, the active hub cluster manages the local clusters and backs up the hub cluster data at regular intervals:

The passive hub cluster restores this data, except for the managed cluster activation data, which moves the managed clusters to the passive hub cluster. The passive hub clusters can restore the passive data continuously. Passive hub clusters can restore passive data as a one-time operation. See _Restoring passive resources_ for more details. 

[#disaster-recovery]
== Disaster recovery

When the primary hub cluster fails, the administrator chooses a passive hub cluster to take over the managed clusters. In the following image, the administrator decides to use _Hub cluster N_ as the new primary hub cluster:

image:../images/disaster_recovery.png[Disaster recovery diagram] 

_Hub cluster N_ restores the managed cluster activation data. At this point, the managed clusters connect with _Hub cluster N_. The administrator activates a backup on the new primary hub cluster, _Hub cluster N_, by creating a `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, and storing the backups at the same storage location as the initial primary hub cluster.

All other passive hub clusters now restore passive data using the backup data created by the new primary hub cluster. _Hub N_ is now the primary hub cluster, managing clusters and backing up data.

*Notes:*

- Process 1 in the previous diagram is not automated because the administrator must decide if the primary hub cluster has failed and needs to be replaced, or if there is a network communication error between the hub cluster and the managed clusters. The administrator also decides which passive hub cluster becomes the primary hub cluster. The policy integration with :aap: jobs can help you automate this step by making a job run when the backup policy reports backup errors.

- Process 2 in the previous diagram is manual. If the administrator does not create backups from the new primary hub cluster, the administrator is notified by using the backups that are actively running as a cron job.
