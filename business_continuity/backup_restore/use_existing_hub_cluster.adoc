[#using-existing-hub]
= Constraints for using an existing hub cluster as a restore hub cluster
If you use an existing hub cluster as a restore hub cluster with resources you created before the restore operation, you must understand the following constraints:

* Existing managed cluster are detached during the restore process.
* There are more resources on the restore hub cluster than the backup hub cluster.

[#existing-clusters-detached]
== Existing managed clusters are detached during the restore process

If the hub cluster you plan to use for the restore operation already manages clusters, and you run a restore operation with the `cleanupBeforeRestore` option set to `CleanupRestored`, expect the following outcomes: 

* If the `ManagedCluster` resources are created by a restored backup, then the resources have the `velero.io/backup-name: backupName` label annotation set. If a user runs a restore operation and uses the `cleanupBeforeRestore=CleanupRestored` option, the managed clusters are detached from the hub cluster and workloads are cleaned up on these managed clusters.
* If a user created the `ManagedCluster` resources, then the resources do not have the `velero.io/backup-name: backupName` label annotation set. If you run a restore operation and use the `cleanupBeforeRestore=CleanupRestored` option, the managed cluster resources are not cleaned up even if the resources are not part of the current restored backup. 

[#restore-hub-resources]
== Restore hub cluster has more resources than the backup hub cluster

When you restore a hub cluster with earlier user-created data and the `cleanupBeforeRestore` option is set to `CleanupRestored` for the restore operation, the resources of your restore hub cluster do not match the resources of the primary hub cluster. The user data includes the following resources: `policy`, `application`, `credential`, or any custom resource defined by the user. The resources are not cleaned because the resources are created by the users and not created by an earlier backup.

If you intend to use an existing hub cluster for a restore hub cluster configuration and expect for the hub cluster to have the same content as the backup hub cluster after the restore is completed, tag any resource that you want to be part of a hub cluster backup. See xref:../backup_restore/tag_resources.adoc#tagging-resources[Tagging resources] for more information.
