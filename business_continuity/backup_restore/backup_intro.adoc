= Backup and restore

The cluster backup and restore operator runs on the hub cluster and provides disaster recovery solutions for {acm} hub cluster failures. When the hub cluster fails, some features, such as policy configuration-based alerting or cluster updates stop working, even if all managed clusters still work. Once the hub cluster is unavailable, you need a recovery plan to decide if recovery is possible, or if the data needs to be recovered on a newly deployed hub cluster.

The backup and restore component provides a set of policies for reporting issues with the backup and restore component, such as backup pods or backup schedules not running. You can use the policy templates to create an alert to the hub cluster administrator if the backup solution is not functioning as expected. For more information, see _Validating your backup or restore configurations_.

The cluster backup and restore operator depends on the link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.15/html/backup_and_restore/oadp-application-backup-and-restore#oadp-release-notes[OADP Operator] to install Velero, and to create a connection from the hub cluster to the backup storage location where the data is stored. Velero is the component that runs the backup and restore operations. The cluster backup and restore operator solution provides backup and restore support for all {acm-short} hub cluster resources, including managed clusters, applications, and policies.

The cluster backup and restore operator supports backups of any third-party resources that extend the hub cluster installation. With this backup solution, you can define cron-based backup schedules which run at specified time intervals. When the hub cluster fails, a new hub cluster can be deployed and the backed up data is moved to the new hub cluster.
