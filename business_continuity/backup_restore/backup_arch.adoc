[#backup-restore-architecture]
= Backup and restore operator architecture

The operator defines the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, which is used to set up {product-title-short} backup schedules, and the `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, which is used to process and restore these backups. The operator creates corresponding Velero resources, and defines the options needed to back up remote clusters and any other hub cluster resources that need to be restored.

[#resources-that-are-backed-up]
== Resources that are backed up

The cluster backup and restore operator solution provides backup and restore support for all hub cluster resources such as managed clusters, applications, and policies. You can use the solution to back up any third-party resources extending the basic hub cluster installation. With this backup solution, you can define a cron-based backup schedule, which runs at specified time intervals and continuously backs up the latest version of the hub cluster content. 

When the hub cluster needs to be replaced or is in a disaster scenario when the hub cluster fails, a new hub cluster can be deployed and backed up data is moved to the new hub cluster.

View the following ordered list of the cluster backup and restore process for identifying backup data:

- Exclude all resources in the `MultiClusterHub` namespace. This is to avoid backing up installation resources that are linked to the current hub cluster identity and should not be backed up.

- Back up all resources with an API version suffixed by `.open-cluster-management.io` and `.hive.openshift.io`. These suffixes indicate that all {product-title-short} resources are backed up.

- Back up all resources from: `argoproj.io`, `app.k8s.io`, `core.observatorium.io`, `hive.openshift.io`. These resources are backed up within the `acm-resources-schedule` backup, with the exception of the resources from the `agent-install.openshift.io` API group. These resources are backed up within the `acm-managed-clusters-schedule` backup.

- Exclude all resources from the following API groups: `internal.open-cluster-management.io`, `operator.open-cluster-management.io`, `work.open-cluster-management.io`, `search.open-cluster-management.io`, `admission.hive.openshift.io`, `proxy.open-cluster-management.io`, `action.open-cluster-management.io`, `view.open-cluster-management.io`, `clusterview.open-cluster-management.io`, `velero.io`.

- Exclude all resources that are a part of the included API groups, but are either not needed or are being recreated by owner resources, which are also backed up: `clustermanagementaddon`, `observabilityaddon`, `applicationmanager`, `certpolicycontroller`, `iampolicycontroller`, `policycontroller`, `searchcollector`, `workmanager`, `backupschedule`, `restore`, `clusterclaim.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`.

- Back up secrets and ConfigMaps with one of the following labels: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/type`, `hive.openshift.io/secret-type`, `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup`. 

- Use the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label for any other resources that you want to be backed up and are not included in the previously mentioned criteria. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: my.group/v1alpha1
kind: MyResource
 metadata:
   labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: ""
----
+
*Note:* Secrets used by the `hive.openshift.io.ClusterDeployment` resource need to be backed up, and are automatically annotated with the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label only when the cluster is created using the console. If the Hive cluster is deployed using GitOps instead, the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label must be manually added to the secrets used by the `ClusterDeployment`.

- Exclude specific resources that you do not want backed up. See the following example to exclude Velero resources from the backup process:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: my.group/v1alpha1
kind: MyResource
 metadata:
  labels:
    velero.io/exclude-from-backup: "true"

[#backup-files-created-by-a-schedule]
== Backup files created by an {product-title-short} schedule 

You can use an {product-title-short} schedule to backup hub resources, which are grouped in separate backup files, based on the resource type or label annotations.

The `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource creates a set of four `schedule.velero.io` resources. These `schedule.velero.io` resources generate the backup files, which are also called resources. 

To view the list of scheduled backup files, run the following command: `oc get schedules -A | grep acm`. 

The scheduled backup files are `backup.velero.io`. See the following table to view the descriptions of these scheduled backup files: 

.Scheduled backup table
|===
| Scheduled backup | Description

| _Credentials backup_
| Stores the following: Hive credentials, {product-title-short}, user-created credentials, and `ConfigMaps`. The name of this backup file is `acm-credentials-schedule-<timestamp>`. 

| _Resources backup_
| Contains one backup for the {product-title-short} resources, `acm-resources-schedule-<timestamp> backup` and one for generic resources, `acm-resources-generic-schedule-<timestamp>`. Any resources annotated with the backup label, `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup`, are stored under the backup, `acm-resources-generic-schedule- backup`. The exceptions are `Secrets` or `ConfigMap` resources which are stored under the backup `acm-credentials-schedule-<timestamp>`. 

| _Managed clusters backup_
| Contains only resources that activate the managed cluster connection to the hub cluster, where the backup is restored. The name of this backup file is `acm-managed-clusters-schedule-<timestamp>`.

[#resources-restored-managed-cluster-activation]
== Resources restored at managed clusters activation time

When you add the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label to a resource, the resource is automatically backed up in the `acm-resources-generic-schedule` backup. You must set the label value to `cluster-activation` if any of the resources need to be restored only after the managed clusters are moved to the new hub cluster and when the `veleroManagedClustersBackupName:latest` is used on the restored resource. This ensures that the resource is not restored unless the managed cluster activation is called. View the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: my.group/v1alpha1
kind: MyResource
 metadata:
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: cluster-activation
----

*Note:* Secrets and config maps are restored when passive resources are restored, regardless of the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label value. Because the `cluster-activation` value is ignored in this case, set the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: cluster-activation` value to the resources using these secrets and config maps instead. This way, the resources are not restored until the activation step.

Aside from the activation data resources that are identified by using the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: cluster-activation` label and stored by the `acm-resources-generic-schedule` backup, the cluster backup and restore operator includes a few resources in the activation set by default. The following resources are backed up by the `acm-managed-clusters-schedule` backup:

- `managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`
- `managedcluster.clusterview.open-cluster-management.io`
- `klusterletaddonconfig.agent.open-cluster-management.io`
- `managedclusteraddon.addon.open-cluster-management.io`
- `managedclusterset.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`
- `managedclusterset.clusterview.open-cluster-management.io`
- `managedclustersetbinding.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`
- `clusterpool.hive.openshift.io`
- `clusterclaim.hive.openshift.io`
- `clustercurator.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`
