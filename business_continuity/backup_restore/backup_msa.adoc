[#auto-connect-clusters-msa]
= Connecting clusters automatically by using a Managed Service Account

The backup controller automatically connects imported clusters to the new hub cluster by using the Managed Service Account component. The Managed Service Account creates a token that is backed up for each imported cluster in each managed cluster namespace. The token uses a `klusterlet-bootstrap-kubeconfig` `ClusterRole` binding, which allows the token to be used by an automatic import operation. The `klusterlet-bootstrap-kubeconfig` `ClusterRole` can only get or update the `bootstrap-hub-kubeconfig` secret. To learn more about the Managed Service Account component, see _What is Managed Service Account?_.

When the activation data is restored on the new hub cluster, the restore controller runs a post restore operation and looks for all managed clusters in the `Pending Import` state. If a valid token generated by the Managed Service Account is found, the controller creates an `auto-import-secret` using the token. As a result, the import component tries to reconnect the managed cluster. If the cluster is accessible, the operation is successful.

[#enabling-auto-import]
== Enabling automatic import

The automatic import feature using the Managed Service Account component is disabled by default. To enable the automatic import feature, complete the following steps:

. Enable the Managed Service Account component by setting the `managedserviceaccount-preview` `enabled` parameter to `true` in the `MultiClusterEngine` resource. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
spec:
  overrides:
    components:
      - enabled: true
        name: managedserviceaccount-preview
----

. Enable the automatic import feature for the `BackupSchedule.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource by setting the `useManagedServiceAccount` parameter to `true`. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: schedule-acm-msa
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  veleroSchedule:
  veleroTtl: 120h
  useManagedServiceAccount: true
----
+
The default token validity duration is set to twice the value of `veleroTtl` to increase the chance of the token being valid for all backups storing the token for their entire lifecycle. In some cases, you might need to control how long a token is valid by setting a value for the optional `managedServiceAccountTTL` property. 
+
Use `managedServiceAccountTTL` with caution if you need to update the default token expiration time for the generated tokens. Changing the token expiration time from the default value might result in producing backups with tokens set to expire during the lifecycle of the backup. As a result, the import feature does not work for the managed clusters.
+
*Important*: Do not use `managedServiceAccountTTL` unless you need to control how long the token is valid.
+
See the following example for using the `managedServiceAccountTTL` property:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: schedule-acm-msa
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  veleroSchedule:
  veleroTtl: 120h
  useManagedServiceAccount: true
  managedServiceAccountTTL: 300h
----

After you enable the automatic import feature, the backup component starts processing imported managed clusters by creating the following:

- A `ManagedServiceAddon` named `managed-serviceaccount`.
- A `ManagedServiceAccount` named `auto-import-account`.
- A `ManifestWork` for each `ManagedServiceAccount` to set up a `klusterlet-bootstrap-kubeconfig` `RoleBinding` for the `ManagedServiceAccount` token on the managed cluster.

The token is only created if the managed cluster is accessible when you create the Managed Service Account, otherwise it is created later once the managed cluster becomes available.

[#auto-import-considerations]
== Automatic import considerations

The following scenarios can prevent the managed cluster from being automatically imported when moving to a new hub cluster:

- When running a hub backup without a `ManagedServiceAccount` token, for example when you create the `ManagedServiceAccount` resource while the managed cluster is not accessible, the backup does not contain a token to auto import the managed cluster.

- The auto import operation fails if the `auto-import-account` secret token is valid and is backed up but the restore operation is run when the token available with the backup has already expired. The `restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource reports invalid token issues for each managed cluster.

- Since the `auto-import-secret` created on restore uses the `ManagedServiceAccount` token to connect to the managed cluster, the managed cluster must also provide the kube `apiserver` information. The `apiserver` must be set on the `ManagedCluster` resource. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: managed-cluster-name
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
  leaseDurationSeconds: 60
  managedClusterClientConfigs:
      url: <apiserver>
----
+
When a cluster is imported on the hub cluster, the `apiserver` is only set up automatically on {ocp-short} clusters. You must set the `apiserver` manually on other types of managed clusters, such as EKS clusters, otherwise the automatic import feature ignores the clusters. As a result, the clusters remain in the `Pending Import` state when you move them to the restore hub cluster.

- It is possible that a `ManagedServiceAccount` secret might not be included in a backup if the backup schedule runs before the backup label is set on the `ManagedServiceAccount` secret. `ManagedServiceAccount` secrets don't have the cluster `open-cluster-management.io/backup` label set on creation. For this reason, the backup controller regularly searches for `ManagedServiceAccount` secrets under the managed cluster's namespaces, and adds the backup label if not found.

[#disabling-auto-import]
== Disabling automatic import

You can disable the automatic import cluster feature by setting the `useManagedServiceAccount` parameter to `false` in the `BackupSchedule` resource. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
  name: schedule-acm-msa
  namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
  veleroSchedule:
  veleroTtl: 120h
  useManagedServiceAccount: false
----

The default value is `false`. After setting the value to `false`, the backup operator removes all created resources, including `ManagedServiceAddon`, `ManagedServiceAccount`, and `ManifestWork`. Removing the resources deletes the automatic import token on the hub cluster and managed cluster.
