[#return-initial-hub]
= Returning to the initial hub cluster after a restore 

In this scenario, run a disaster recovery test by simulating a disaster that makes the primary hub cluster unusable, requiring you to restore hub cluster data on a new hub cluster. In this simulation, the backup data is restored to a new hub cluster, and you must verify that all the data is recovered successfully.

After you complete all the required tests, return to the initial hub cluster by using the primary hub cluster as the active hub cluster. To do this, restore the data back to the initial hub cluster. This action is known as controlled recovery operation because you are able to control the timing of the recovery operation. You can run any required steps to prepare the primary hub cluster, so that you can reuse the hub cluster after completing the disaster recovery test. 

[#return-initial-prereq]
== Prerequisite 

To prepare the backup hub cluster for the restore operation and to run the restore, complete the following documentation: xref:../backup_restore/backup_active_restore.adoc#keep-hub-active-restore[Keeping the primary hub cluster active during a restore process]. 

[#making-active-hub]
== Making the new hub cluster the active hub cluster  

To begin the simulation, you must make the new hub cluster the active hub cluster by completing the following steps:

. Run the restore operation on the new hub cluster to make it the active hub cluster.
. To verify that the managed clusters are now connected to the new hub cluster, check the status of the managed clusters from the cluster console. 
. Run your disaster recovery simulation tests on the new hub cluster.

[#returning-primary-hub]
== Returning to the primary hub cluster 

After your disaster recovery tests complete, you can return to the primary hub cluster and make it the active hub cluster that manages the cluster fleet. To do this, complete the following sections to return to the primary cluster:

* <<creating-backup,Creating a backup on the restore hub cluster>>
* <<preparing-restore-hub,Preparing the restore hub cluster for the move>>
* <<making-initial-hub,Making the initial hub cluster the active hub cluster>>
* <<enabling-backup-schedule,Enabling the backup schedule on the primary hub cluster>>

[#creating-backup]
=== Creating a backup on the restore hub cluster

To restore the data back to the initial hub cluster, create a backup on the restore hub cluster by completing the following steps: 

. On the restore hub cluster, apply the following resource:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
 name: schedule-acm-msa
 namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
 veleroSchedule: "0 */1 * * *"
 veleroTtl: 120h
 useManagedServiceAccount: true
 paused: false
----

. Make sure the {acm-short} backups are generated and have the `Completed` status.

[#preparing-restore-hub]
=== Preparing the restore hub cluster for the move 

To prepare the restore hub cluster for the move back to the initial hub cluster, complete the following steps on the restore hub cluster: 

. Pause the backup schedule by setting the `paused=true` property on the `schedule-acm-msa BackupSchedule` resource.
. To ensure the `ManagedCluster` resources do not connect back to the initial hub cluster after getting moved back to the primary hub cluster, add the `import.open-cluster-management.io/disable-auto-import: ''` annotation to all `ManagedCluster` resources.

[#making-initial-hub]
=== Making the initial hub cluster the active hub cluster

When you make the initial hub cluster the active hub cluster, all the managed clusters are returned to and managed by the initial hub cluster. To do this, complete the following steps:

. Go to the initial hub cluster. 
. Restore all the resources from the secondary hub cluster backup by applying the following restore resource: 

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Restore
metadata:
 name: restore-acm
 namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
 cleanupBeforeRestore: CleanupRestored
 veleroManagedClustersBackupName: latest
 veleroCredentialsBackupName: latest
 veleroResourcesBackupName: latest
----
+
*Note:* When you set the `cleanupBeforeRestore` property to `CleanupRestored`, a cleanup operation runs after all resources are restored. This cleanup operation removes any hub resource that is not part of the restored backup. 

[#enabling-backup-schedule]
=== Enabling the backup schedule on the primary hub cluster 

Now that the initial hub cluster is the primary hub cluster again, enable the backup schedule on the primary hub cluster by completing the following steps:

. Go to the primary hub cluster.
. Apply the following `BackupSchedule` resource: 

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: BackupSchedule
metadata:
 name: schedule-acm-msa
 namespace: open-cluster-management-backup
spec:
 veleroSchedule: "0 */1 * * *"
 veleroTtl: 120h
 useManagedServiceAccount: true
 paused: false
----
+
*Note:* The second hub cluster can be used again as the secondary hub cluster in the `active-passive` configuration.
