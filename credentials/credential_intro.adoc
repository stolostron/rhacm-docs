= Managing credentials overview

You can create and manage your cluster credentials. A _credential_ is required to create a {ocp} cluster on a cloud service provider with {product-title}. The credential stores the access information for a cloud provider. Each provider account requires its own credential, as does each domain on a single provider.

Credentials are rotated regularly. Secrets are copied to the namespace of a managed cluster so the controllers for the managed cluster can access the secrets. To reference a secret, the pod must be in the same namespace as the secret. When a credential is updated, the secret is automatically updated in the managed cluster namespaces that contain a copy of the secret.

*Note:* Changes to the pull secret or SSH keys of cloud provider credentials are not reflected for existing managed clusters, as they have already been provisioned using the original credentials.

**Required access**: Cluster administrator
