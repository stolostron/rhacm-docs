= Creating a credential for Google Cloud Platform

You need a credential to use {product-title} console to create and manage a {ocp} cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

**Required access**: Edit

*Note:* This procedure is a prerequisite for creating a cluster with {product-title}.

[#google_cred_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a credential:

* A deployed {product-title} hub cluster
* Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on GCP
* GCP login credentials, which include user Google Cloud Platform Project ID and Google Cloud Platform service account JSON key.
See https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects[Creating and managing projects].
* Account permissions that allow installing clusters on GCP.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.html[Configuring a GCP project] for instructions on how to configure an account.

== Managing a credential by using the console

To create a credential from the {product-title} console, complete the steps in the console. 

Start at the navigation menu. Click *Credentials* to choose from existing credential options. *Tip:* Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, for both convenience and security.

You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your credential. If you add the base DNS domain to the credential, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this credential. See the following steps:

. Add your _Google Cloud Platform project ID_ for your GCP account.
Log in to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey[GCP] to retrieve your settings.
. Add your _Google Cloud Platform service account JSON key_. See the (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) to create your service account JSON key. Follow the steps for the GCP console.

. In the {product-title-short}, provide the contents for your new _Google Cloud Platform service account JSON key_.
. [[proxy-google]]If you want to enable a proxy, enter the proxy information: 
+
* HTTP proxy URL: The URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

* HTTPS proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`. 

* No proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add and asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

* Additional trust bundle: The contents of the certificate file that is required to access the mirror registry.
. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift pull secret_. You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH private key_ and _SSH public key_ so you can access the cluster. You can use an existing key pair, or create a new pair using a key generation program.

See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-default.html#ssh-agent-using_installing-gcp-default[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent] for more information about how to generate a key.

You can use this connection when you create a cluster by completing the steps in link:../multicluster_engine/create_google.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-google-cloud-platform[Creating a cluster on Google Cloud Platform].

You can edit your credential in the console. 

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential. Select *Actions* to delete in bulk, or select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.
