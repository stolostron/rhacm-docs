= Creating a credential for Google Cloud Platform

You need a credential to use {product-title} console to create and manage a {ocp} cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

*Note:* This procedure is a prerequisite for creating a cluster with {product-title}.

[#google_cred_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a credential:

* A deployed {product-title} hub cluster
* Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on GCP
* GCP login credentials, which include user Google Cloud Platform Project ID and Google Cloud Platform service account JSON key.
See https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects[Creating and managing projects].
* Account permissions that allow installing clusters on GCP.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.html[Configuring a GCP project] for instructions on how to configure an account.

[#gcp_cred]
== Creating a credential by using the console

To create a credential from the {product-title} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Credentials*. Existing credentials are displayed.

. Select *Add credential*.
. Select *Google Cloud Platform* as your provider.
. Add a name for your credential.
. Select a namespace for your credential from the list.
+
*Tip:* Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, for both convenience and security.

. You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your credential. If you add the base DNS domain to the credential, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this credential.
. Add your _Google Cloud Platform project ID_ for your GCP account.
Log in to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey[GCP] to retrieve your settings.
. Add your _Google Cloud Platform service account JSON key_. Complete the following steps to create one with the correct permissions:
.. In the GCP main menu, select *IAM & Admin* and start the *Service Accounts applet*
.. Select *Create Service Account*.
.. Provide the _Name_, _Service account ID_, and _Description_ of your service account.
.. Select *Create* to create the service account.
.. Select a role of *Owner*, and click *Continue*.
.. Click *Create Key*
.. Select *JSON*, and click *Create*. 
.. Save the resulting file to your computer.
.. Provide the contents for the _Google Cloud Platform service account JSON key_.
. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift pull secret_.
You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH private key_ and _SSH public key_ so you can access the cluster.
You can use an existing key pair, or create a new pair using a key generation program.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-default.html#ssh-agent-using_installing-gcp-default[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent] for more information about how to generate a key.
. Click *Create*.
When you create the credential, it is added to the list of credentials.

You can use this connection when you create a cluster by completing the steps in xref:../clusters/create_google.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-google-cloud-platform[Creating a cluster on Google Cloud Platform].

[#gcp_delete_cred]
== Deleting your credential

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential.

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Credentials*.
. Select the options menu for the credential that you want to delete.
. Select *Delete credential*.
