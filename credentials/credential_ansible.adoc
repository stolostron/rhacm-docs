= Creating a credential for Ansible Automation Platform

[#ansible_cred_prereqs]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a credential:

* A deployed {product-title} hub cluster
* Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster
* Ansible login credentials, which include access key ID and secret access key; see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html[Credentials for Ansible Tower].
* Account permissions that allow installing clusters on Ansible.

== Creating a credential by using the console

To create a credential from the {product-title} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Credentials*. Existing credential options are displayed.

. Select *Add credential*.
. Select *Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform* as your provider.
. Add a name for your credential.
. Select a namespace for your credential from the list.
+
*Tip:* Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, both for convenience and added security.

. You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your credential. If you add the base DNS domain to the credential, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this credential.
. Add your _Ansible access key ID_ for your Ansible account.
Log in to Ansible to find the ID.
. Add your _Ansible Secret Access Key_.
. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift pull secret_.
You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH private key_ and _SSH public key_, which allows you to connect to the cluster. You can use an existing key pair, or create a new one with key generation program. 
. Click *Create*.
. Review the new credential information, then click *Add*. When you add the credential, it is added to the list of credentials.
		
[#ansible_delete_cred]
== Deleting your credential

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential.

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Credentials*.
. Select *Actions* to delete in bulk, or select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.
. Select *Delete credentials* or *Delete credential*.
