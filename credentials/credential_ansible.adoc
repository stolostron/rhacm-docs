= Creating a credential for Ansible Automation Platform

You need a credential to use {product-title} console to deploy and manage an {ocp} cluster that is using Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

**Required access**: Edit

*Note:* This procedure must be done before you can create an Ansible job template to enable automation on a {product-title-short} cluster.

[#ansible_cred_prereqs]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a credential:

* A deployed {product-title} hub cluster
* Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster
* Ansible login credentials, which includes Ansible Tower hostname and OAuth token; see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html[Credentials for Ansible Tower].
* Account permissions that allow you to install hub clusters and work with Ansible. Learn more about https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/users.html[Ansible users].

== Managing a credential by using the console

To create a credential from the {product-title} console, complete the steps in the console. 

Start at the navigation menu. Click *Credentials* to choose from existing credential options. *Tip:* Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, both for convenience and added security.

The Ansible Token and host URL that you provide when you create your Ansible credential are automatically updated for the automations that use that credential when you edit the credential. The updates are copied to any automations that use that Ansible credential, including those related to cluster lifecycle, governance, and application management automations. This ensures that the automations continue to run after the credential is updated. 

You can edit your credential in the console. Ansible credentials are automatically updated in your automation that use that credential when you update them in the credential.

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential. Select *Actions* to delete in bulk, or select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.
