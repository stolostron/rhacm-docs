[#azure_cred_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a credential:

* A deployed {product-title} hub cluster.
* Internet access for your {product-title} hub cluster so that it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Azure.
* Azure login credentials, which include your Base Domain Resource Group and Azure Service Principal JSON.
See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/features/azure-portal[azure.microsoft.com].
* Account permissions that allow installing clusters on Azure.
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-how-to-configure-portal[How to configure Cloud Services] and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-account.html[Configuring an Azure account] for more information.

== Creating a credential by using the console

To create a credential from the {product-title} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Credentials*. Existing credentials are displayed.

. Select *Add credential*.
. Select *Microsoft Azure* as your provider.
. Add a name for your credential.
. Select a namespace for your credential from the list.
+
*Tip:* You can create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, both for convenience and added security.

. You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your credential. If you add the base DNS domain to the credential, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this credential.
. Add your _Base domain resource group name_ for your Azure account.
This entry is the resource name that you created with your Azure account.
You can find your Base Domain Resource Group Name by selecting *Home* > *DNS Zones* in the Azure interface.
Your Base domain resource group name is in the _Resource Group_ column of the entry that contains the Base DNS domain that applies to your account.
. Add your _Client ID_. This value is generated as the `appId` property when you create a service principal with the following command: 
+
----
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --name <service_principal>
----
Replace _service_principal_ with the name of your service principal.
. Add your _Client Secret_. This value is generated as the `password` property when you create a service principal with the following command:
+
----
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --name <service_principal>
----
Replace _service_principal_ with the name of your service principal.
. Add your _Subscription ID_. This value is the `id` property in the output of the following command:
+
----
az account show
----
. Add your _Tenant ID_. This value is the `tenantId` property in the output of the following command:
+
----
az account show
----
. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift pull secret_.
You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH private key_ and _SSH public key_ to use to connect to the cluster.
You can use an existing key pair, or create a new pair using a key generation program.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-default.html#ssh-agent-using_installing-azure-default[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent] for more information about how to generate a key.
. Click *Create*.
. Review the new credential information, then click *Add*. When you add the credential, it is added to the list of credentials.

You can create a cluster that uses this credential by completing the steps in link:../clusters/create_azure.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-microsoft-azure[Creating a cluster on Microsoft Azure].

[#azure_delete_cred]
== Deleting your credential

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential.

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Credentials*.
. Select *Actions* to delete in bulk, or select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.
. Select *Delete credentials* or **Delete credential*.
