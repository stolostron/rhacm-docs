= Creating a credential for VMware vSphere

You need a credential to use {product-title} console to deploy and manage a {ocp} cluster on VMware vSphere. *Note:* Only {ocp-short} versions 4.5.x, and later, are supported.

**Required access**: Edit

*Note:* This procedure must be done before you can create a cluster with {product-title-short}.

[#vsphere_cred_prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before you create a credential:

* A deployed {product-title-short} hub cluster on {ocp-short} version 4.6 or later.
* Internet access for your {product-title-short} hub cluster so it can create the Kubernetes cluster on VMware vSphere.
* VMware vSphere login credentials and vCenter requirements configured for {ocp-short} when using installer-provisioned infrastructure.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned.html[Installing a cluster on vSphere]. These credentials include the following information:
** vCenter account privileges.
** Cluster resources.
** DHCP available.
** ESXi hosts have time synchronized (for example, NTP).

== Creating a credential by using the console

To create a credential from the {product-title-short} console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Credentials*. Existing credentials are displayed.

. Select *Add credential*.
. Select *VMware vSphere* as your provider.
. Add a name for your credential.
. Select a namespace for your credential from the list.
+
*Tip:* Create a namespace specifically to host your credentials, for both convenience and added security.

. You can optionally add a _Base DNS domain_ for your credential. If you add the base DNS domain to the credential, it is automatically populated in the correct field when you create a cluster with this credential.
. Add your _VMware vCenter server fully-qualified host name or IP address_. The value must be defined in the vCenter server root CA certificate. If possible, use the fully-qualified host name.
. Add your _VMware vCenter username_.
. Add your _VMware vCenter password_.
. Add your _VMware vCenter root CA certificate_.
.. You can download your certificate in the `download.zip` package with the certificate from your VMware vCenter server at: `https://<vCenter_address>/certs/download.zip`. Replace _vCenter_address_ with the address to your vCenter server. 
.. Unpackage the `download.zip`.
.. Use the certificate from the `certs/<platform>` directory that has a `.0` extension. *Tip:* You can use the `ls certs/<platform>` command to list all of the available certificates for your platform.
+
Replace `_<platform>_` with the abbreviation for your platform: `lin`, `mac`, or `win`. 
+
For example: `certs/lin/3a343545.0`
. Add your _VMware vSphere cluster name_.
. Add your _VMware vSphere datacenter_.
. Add your _VMware vSphere default datastore_.

. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift pull secret_.
You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH private key_ and _SSH public key_, which allows you to connect to the cluster.
You can use an existing key pair, or create a new one with key generation program.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-default.html#ssh-agent-using_installing-aws-default[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent] for more information.
. Click *Create*.
When you create the credential, it is added to the list of credentials.

You can create a cluster that uses this credential by completing the steps in link:../clusters/create_vm.adoc#creating-a-cluster-on-vmware-vsphere[Creating a cluster on VMware vSphere].

[#vsphere_delete_cred]
== Deleting your credential

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a credential, delete the credential to protect the information in the credential.

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Credentials*.
. Select the options menu beside the credential that you want to delete.
. Select *Delete credential*.
